## Phishing & Security Reporting

Security is everyone's responsibility. If you see something suspicious, report it immediately.

### How to Report Phishing

#### In Gmail (Preferred)

1.  Open the suspicious email.
2.  Click the "Report Phishing" button in the sidebar (or the 3-dot menu > Report phishing).
3.  This automatically quarantines the email and notifies the Security Operations Center (SOC).

#### In Slack

1.  Hover over the message.
2.  Click the 3-dot menu.
3.  Select "Report Security Issue".

#### Via Email

Forward suspicious emails as an attachment to `phishing@company.com`.

### What to Report

*   **Urgent requests**: "CEO needs gift cards", "Update payroll immediately".
*   **Mismatched links**: Hover over links to see the actual URL.
*   **Unexpected attachments**: Invoices or receipts you didn't request.
*   **Password requests**: IT will never ask for your password.

### If You Clicked a Link

Don't panic, but act fast.

1.  **Disconnect**: Turn off Wi-Fi / unplug Ethernet.
2.  **Report**: Call the Security Hotline immediately at `+1-555-0911` (internal).
3.  **Reset Password**: Use a different device (phone) to reset your password.

### Lost Devices

If you lose your laptop or phone:
1.  Report it to `#help-security` or `security@company.com` immediately.
2.  We can remotely wipe the device to protect data.
