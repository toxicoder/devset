## Password Reset Procedures

Maintaining a secure password is critical. If you have forgotten your password or need to change it, follow the steps below.

### Self-Service Password Reset

The fastest way to reset your password is via our self-service portal.

1.  Go to `https://sso.company.com/forgot-password`.
2.  Enter your employee email address.
3.  Complete the MFA verification (SMS or Authenticator App).
4.  Enter and confirm your new password.

### Manual Password Reset

If you cannot access the self-service portal or are locked out of your MFA device:

1.  Contact the IT Service Desk at `support@company.com` or call `+1-555-0199`.
2.  You will need to verify your identity with your manager or via a video call with IT.

### Password Requirements

*   Minimum 12 characters.
*   Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
*   Cannot be one of your last 5 passwords.
*   Must not contain your name or username.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Account Locked**: After 5 failed attempts, your account is locked for 15 minutes. Wait or contact IT.
*   **MFA Not Working**: Ensure your device time is synced.
