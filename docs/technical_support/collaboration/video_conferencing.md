## Video Conferencing (Zoom/Google Meet)

We use **Zoom** as our primary video conferencing tool and **Google Meet** as a backup.

### Zoom Setup

1.  **Login**: Use SSO (`company.zoom.us`).
2.  **Plugin**: Install the Google Calendar plugin to add Zoom links to meetings automatically.

### Conference Rooms

*   **Zoom Rooms**: Most meeting rooms are equipped with "Zoom Room" controllers (iPad).
*   **Joining**:
    1.  Book the room in Google Calendar.
    2.  Tap "Start" on the iPad controller when you arrive.
*   **Wireless Sharing**: Use the "Share Screen" button on the controller or enter the "Sharing Key" displayed on the TV.

### Best Practices

*   **Camera On**: Encouraged for team meetings to build connection.
*   **Mute**: Mute when not speaking to reduce background noise.
*   **Recording**:
    *   Inform participants before recording.
    *   Cloud recordings are retained for 30 days.
    *   Sensitive meetings should not be recorded to the cloud.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Audio Issues**: Check your input/output device in Zoom settings *before* the call.
*   **Lag**: Turn off your camera if your internet connection is unstable.
