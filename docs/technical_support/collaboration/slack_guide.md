# Slack Guide

## Overview
This document provides detailed technical support information for **Slack Guide**. It is intended for end-users and support staff.

## Configuration & Instructions
## Slack Best Practices

Slack is our digital HQ. Using it effectively helps reduce noise and increase productivity.

### Channel Naming Conventions

*   `#team-NAME`: Team-specific discussions (e.g., `#team-platform`).
*   `#proj-NAME`: Project-specific (e.g., `#proj-migration`).
*   `#feat-NAME`: Feature development.
*   `#help-TOPIC`: Support channels (e.g., `#help-it`, `#help-hr`).
*   `#social-TOPIC`: Non-work (e.g., `#social-pets`, `#social-gaming`).
*   `#announce-TOPIC`: Read-only announcements.

### Etiquette

*   **Threads**: Always use threads for replies to keep channels clean.
*   **@here / @channel**: Use sparingly. Prefer `@user` or just posting the message.
*   **Status**: Sync your status with your calendar (Google Calendar app does this automatically).
*   **Availability**: Respect "Do Not Disturb" hours.

### Retention Policy

*   **Public Channels**: 90 days.
*   **Private Channels**: 90 days.
*   **Direct Messages**: 30 days.

*Important: Do not use Slack for long-term documentation or decision records. Use Google Docs or the Wiki.*

### Slack Connect

We can connect shared channels with external partners/vendors. Request a Slack Connect channel via `#help-it`.

## Troubleshooting Guide
1.  **Reproduce:** Try to reproduce the issue consistently.
2.  **Isolate:** Determine if the issue is with the hardware, software, or network.
3.  **Logs:** Check the logs for specific error codes.

## Getting Help
If the issue persists:
1.  Search the Knowledge Base.
2.  Ask in the `#general-support` Slack channel.
3.  Open a Jira ticket.
