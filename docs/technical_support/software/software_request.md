## Software Requests

We maintain a catalog of approved software. Installing unapproved software poses a security risk.

### Approved Software

Check the **Self-Service App Store** (Mac) or **Company Portal** (Windows) on your laptop. These apps are pre-approved and can be installed immediately.

Examples:
*   Slack, Zoom, Chrome, Firefox
*   VS Code, Docker Desktop
*   Notion, Figma
*   Microsoft Office 365

### Requesting New Software

If you need software not in the catalog:

1.  **Search**: Check `https://software.company.com` to see if it has been reviewed previously.
2.  **Submit Request**: If not found, submit a "New Software Request" ticket.
    *   **Commercial Software**: Requires budget approval from your manager and procurement review.
    *   **Free/Open Source**: Requires a security review to check for malware/license compliance.
3.  **Review Process**:
    *   **Security Review**: 3-5 business days.
    *   **Procurement**: Varies based on contract negotiation.

### License Management

*   **Adobe Creative Cloud**: Request via ticket. Assignable to Design roles automatically.
*   **JetBrains**: Self-assign via the [Developer Tools](developer_tools.md) portal.
