# Corporate Structuring & Entities

This document defines the legal entity structure of [Company Name], explaining when and why we use specific structures like C-Corps, LLCs, and Subsidiaries.

## 1. Top-Level Structure: Delaware C-Corp

The parent company is incorporated as a **Delaware C-Corporation**.

### Why Delaware?
*   **Legal Precedent:** The Court of Chancery provides predictable, business-savvy legal rulings.
*   **Investor Preference:** VCs and institutional investors almost exclusively invest in Delaware C-Corps.
*   **Efficiency:** Administrative filings and corporate governance are streamlined.

### Why C-Corp?
*   **Stock Options:** C-Corps allow for the issuance of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS), which have significant tax advantages for employees and founders.
*   **Separation:** Distinct separation between ownership and management.

## 2. When to Use LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)

While the parent is a C-Corp, we utilize LLCs for specific subsidiary purposes where "pass-through" taxation or liability isolation is beneficial.

### Use Cases for LLCs:
*   **Asset Holding:** Real estate or high-risk physical assets may be held in separate LLCs to protect the parent company's core IP from liability claims (e.g., a slip-and-fall lawsuit at a warehouse).
*   **Joint Ventures:** When partnering with another company for a specific project, an LLC allows for flexible profit-sharing agreements that differ from share ownership.
*   **Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs):** For investment or specific acquisition activities.

### When NOT to use LLCs:
*   **Venture Capital:** We do not raise venture capital into an LLC structure due to UBTI (Unrelated Business Taxable Income) issues for limited partners (LPs).

## 3. Subsidiary Strategy

We form wholly-owned subsidiaries for two primary reasons: **International Operations** and **Regulatory Isolation**.

### International Expansion
*   **Talent:** To hire full-time employees in another country (e.g., UK, India, Canada), we must establish a local entity (e.g., [Company Name] UK Ltd).
*   **Sales:** To sell to enterprise customers in the EU, a local entity often simplifies VAT collection and contracting.

### Transfer Pricing
Subsidiaries operate on an "Arm's Length" basis. The parent company (IP Owner) charges the subsidiary (Sales/R&D Service Provider) a fee. This ensures tax compliance in both jurisdictions.

## 4. Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy

All Intellectual Property is assigned to and held by the **Parent Delaware C-Corp**.
*   **Invention Assignment Agreements:** Every employee and contractor signs a PIIA (Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment) vesting IP rights in the parent company immediately upon creation.
*   **Intercompany Agreements:** Subsidiaries do not own the code they write; they perform "R&D Services" for the parent company, which retains the IP.

## 5. Cap Table Management

*   **Authorized Shares:** The total number of shares the company *can* issue (requires Board/Shareholder approval to change).
*   **Issued & Outstanding:** Shares actually owned by founders, investors, and employees.
*   **Option Pool:** Shares reserved for future employee grants (typically 10-15% of fully diluted capitalization).
