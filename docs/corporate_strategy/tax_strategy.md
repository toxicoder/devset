# Tax Strategy & Compliance

This document outlines [Company Name]'s approach to global tax compliance, optimization, and risk management. Our strategy is to pay the correct amount of tax in every jurisdiction while leveraging legal incentives to fuel R&D and growth.

## 1. Research & Development (R&D) Tax Credits

As a technology company, our largest investment is in engineering. We aggressively substantiate and claim R&D tax credits.

### Section 41 (US Federal)
*   **Qualified Research Expenses (QREs):** We track engineering wages, cloud computing costs (AWS/GCP) used for dev/test environments, and US-based contractor fees.
*   **The 4-Part Test:** To qualify, activities must:
    1.  Be technological in nature.
    2.  Be for a permitted purpose (new/improved product or process).
    3.  Eliminate technical uncertainty.
    4.  Follow a process of experimentation.

**Action:** Engineering Managers must maintain documentation (Jira tickets, Design Docs) that proves the "uncertainty" and "experimentation" involved in their work.

## 2. Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)

We structure the company to maintain **QSBS (Section 1202)** eligibility for as long as possible.
*   **Benefit:** If eligibility is maintained, founders and early employees may exclude up to 100% of capital gains from federal tax (up to $10M or 10x basis) upon exit, provided the stock is held for 5+ years.
*   **Constraint:** The company must remain a C-Corp and have less than $50M in gross assets at the time of stock issuance.

## 3. Transfer Pricing (International)

As we expand globally, we adhere to the **Arm's Length Principle** mandated by the OECD.
*   **Model:** We typically operate on a **"Cost Plus"** basis for international subsidiaries.
    *   *Example:* The UK subsidiary incurs £1M in costs (salaries, rent). The US Parent pays the UK subsidiary £1M + X% markup. The UK entity pays tax on that small markup, while the US Parent deducts the full cost.
*   **Risk:** Incorrect transfer pricing is the #1 audit risk for multinational tech companies. We engage Big 4 accounting firms for periodic Transfer Pricing Studies.

## 4. Sales Tax & Nexus (Wayfair Decision)

In the US, we must collect sales tax in any state where we have **Nexus**.
*   **Physical Nexus:** Having an employee, office, or server in a state.
*   **Economic Nexus:** Exceeding a revenue or transaction threshold (e.g., $100k sales or 200 transactions) in a state, even without physical presence.

**Strategy:** We utilize automated tax compliance software (e.g., Avalara, Stripe Tax) to calculate and remit sales tax in real-time.

## 5. Stock-Based Compensation (409A)

To issue stock options without incurring immediate tax liabilities for employees, we must issue them at **Fair Market Value (FMV)**.
*   **409A Valuation:** We commission an independent 409A valuation from a third-party firm at least every 12 months, or after any "material event" (e.g., a new funding round).
*   **Compliance:** Issuing options below FMV triggers severe tax penalties for employees (20% surtax + interest).

## 6. NOL Strategy (Net Operating Losses)

In growth years where the company operates at a loss, we accrue **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)**.
*   **Carryforward:** These losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income when the company becomes profitable.
*   **Section 382 Limitation:** If the company undergoes an "Ownership Change" (cumulative >50% change in ownership over 3 years), the ability to use these NOLs is limited. This is a critical consideration during fundraising rounds.
