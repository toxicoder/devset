# Financial Strategy & Guidelines

This document outlines the high-level financial principles and strategies that drive capital allocation, budgeting, and growth at [Company Name].

## 1. Capital Allocation Framework

Our primary goal is to maximize long-term free cash flow per share. We allocate capital based on a **70/20/10** model:

*   **70% Core Business:** Investment in proven revenue engines (e.g., Sales capacity, reliability engineering). Low risk, predictable returns.
*   **20% Adjacent Opportunities:** Expanding existing products into new markets or adding complementary features. Medium risk.
*   **10% Moonshots:** High-risk, high-reward R&D projects (e.g., AI research, new product lines). Most will fail, but one success can define the next decade.

## 2. The "Rule of 40" (SaaS Metric)

As a growth-stage technology company, we balance growth and profitability using the **Rule of 40**:

$$ \text{Growth Rate (\%)} + \text{Profit Margin (\%)} \ge 40 $$

*   **Implication:** If we are growing at 100% YoY, we can afford to burn cash (-60% margin). If growth slows to 20%, we must generate 20% profit.
*   **Target:** We aim to stay above the line, prioritizing growth in early stages and efficiency as we mature.

## 3. Unit Economics

We do not scale negative unit economics. Before aggressive GTM expansion, a product line must demonstrate:

*   **LTV / CAC > 3.0:** The Lifetime Value of a customer must be at least 3x the Cost to Acquire them.
*   **Payback Period < 12 Months:** We should recover the CAC within the first year of the customer contract.

### Key Definitions
*   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** (Sales + Marketing Spend) / New Customers Acquired.
*   **LTV (Lifetime Value):** (ARPU * Gross Margin %) / Churn Rate.

## 4. Budgeting & Burn Rate

### Zero-Based Budgeting
We do not simply add 10% to last year's budget. Every fiscal year, department heads must justify all expenses from zero, ensuring resources flow to the highest ROI activities, not just legacy programs.

### Runway Management
We maintain a minimum of **18 months of runway** (cash in bank / monthly burn) at all times to weather macroeconomic downturns without forced layoffs.

## 5. Procurement & Spending Authority

To maintain speed while ensuring control:
*   **Software/SaaS:** All new software subscriptions must undergo a Security & Compliance review.
*   **Cloud Spend:** Infrastructure spend is monitored daily. R&D engineering is empowered to spin up resources, but "zombie" instances (idle resources) are aggressively terminated.
*   **Travel:** We fly economy for flights under 6 hours. We invest the savings in product.

## 6. Equity Compensation Strategy

We view equity as a primary wealth creation vehicle for employees.
*   **Grant Strategy:** We target the 75th percentile of market data for equity grants.
*   **Refreshers:** Performance-based equity refreshers are granted annually to retain top talent and align long-term incentives.
*   **Exercise Windows:** We support extended exercise windows (up to 10 years) for vested options where legally feasible, acknowledging that liquidity events take time.
