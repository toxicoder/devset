# System Design Interview Questions & Answers (100+)

This guide contains 100+ System Design interview questions, ranging from core concepts to complex distributed system scenarios. Each question includes a model answer and potential follow-up paths based on the candidate's response.

## Part 1: Core Concepts (1-25)

### 1. What is the difference between Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling?

| Feature | Vertical Scaling (Scale Up) | Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. | Adding more machines to the resource pool. |
| **Limit** | Hard limit based on hardware capacity. | Theoretically infinite (constrained by software/network). |
| **Downtime** | Usually requires downtime to upgrade. | No downtime (add nodes dynamically). |
| **Complexity** | Low (no distributed logic). | High (requires load balancing, consistency mgmt). |

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Candidate mentions Cost.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "At what point does vertical scaling become more expensive than horizontal?"
    *   *Answer:* Specialized high-end hardware follows a non-linear price curve. Two medium servers are often cheaper than one super-server.
*   **Path B: Candidate focuses on Databases.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Why is it harder to horizontally scale a traditional SQL database?"
    *   *Answer:* ACID compliance and JOINS are difficult to maintain across distributed nodes.

### 2. Explain Load Balancing (L4 vs L7).

A Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers.

*   **Layer 4 (Transport Layer):** Routes traffic based on IP address and Port (TCP/UDP). It is packet-level load balancing.
*   **Layer 7 (Application Layer):** Routes traffic based on content (URL, Cookies, Headers). It is request-level load balancing.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Performance.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Which is faster, L4 or L7?"
    *   *Answer:* L4 is faster because it doesn't need to decrypt/inspect the payload.
*   **Path B: Security.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Why is L7 better for security?"
    *   *Answer:* It can inspect traffic for SQL injection, terminate SSL, and implement smarter rate limiting.

### 3. What is the CAP Theorem?

In a distributed data store, you can strictly provide only two of the three guarantees:

1.  **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2.  **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
3.  **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network.

```mermaid
graph TD
    C[Consistency] --- A[Availability]
    A --- P[Partition Tolerance]
    P --- C
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style A fill:#ff9,stroke:#333
    style P fill:#9ff,stroke:#333
```

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: "I choose CA".**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Can a distributed system actually be CA?"
    *   *Answer:* No. In a distributed system, network partitions *will* happen. You effectively choose between CP (stop serving requests) or AP (serve stale data) when a partition occurs.

### 4. Compare ACID vs BASE models.

*   **ACID (Relational DBs):** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. Focuses on strict data integrity.
*   **BASE (NoSQL DBs):**
    *   **B**asically **A**vailable: System guarantees availability.
    *   **S**oft state: State may change over time, even without input.
    *   **E**ventual consistency: System will become consistent over time.

### 5. What are the common Caching Strategies?

1.  **Cache Aside (Lazy Loading):** App checks cache. If miss, reads DB, writes to cache.
2.  **Read-Through:** App asks cache. Cache fetches from DB if miss.
3.  **Write-Through:** App writes to cache and DB synchronously.
4.  **Write-Back (Write-Behind):** App writes to cache. Cache writes to DB asynchronously.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Write-Back.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What is the major risk of Write-Back?"
    *   *Answer:* Data loss if the cache crashes before flushing data to the persistent DB.

### 6. What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?

A network of geographically distributed servers that deliver static content (images, CSS, JS, videos) to users based on their location.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Push vs Pull.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "How does the CDN get the content?"
    *   *Answer:* **Push:** You upload to CDN. **Pull:** CDN fetches from Origin on first request (cache miss).

### 7. Stateless vs Stateful Architecture?

*   **Stateless:** Server retains no client information between requests. Every request must contain all necessary info (e.g., JWT). Scales easily.
*   **Stateful:** Server remembers client data (Session ID) from previous requests. Harder to scale horizontally (requires Sticky Sessions).

### 8. Latency vs Throughput?

*   **Latency:** Time taken to process a single request (Speed).
*   **Throughput:** Number of requests processed per unit time (Capacity).

**Analogy:**
*   *Latency:* How fast a car drives.
*   *Throughput:* How many cars pass a point per hour.

### 9. What are common Availability Patterns?

1.  **Fail-over:**
    *   *Active-Passive:* Heartbeat sends signal. If Active dies, Passive takes over.
    *   *Active-Active:* Both handle traffic.
2.  **Replication:** Master-Slave, Master-Master.

### 10. How does DNS Resolution work?

1.  Browser checks local cache.
2.  OS checks `hosts` file.
3.  Query sent to **Recursive Resolver** (ISP).
4.  Resolver queries **Root Server** (.) -> **TLD Server** (.com) -> **Authoritative Name Server** (example.com).
5.  IP returned to browser.

### 11. What is Consistent Hashing?

A technique to distribute data across nodes in a way that minimizes reorganization when nodes are added or removed.
Instead of `hash(key) % N`, it maps keys and nodes to a "Ring" (0 to 2^32).

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Hotspots.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What if one node is very powerful or gets too much data?"
    *   *Answer:* Use "Virtual Nodes" (vnodes). Map one physical node to multiple points on the ring.

### 12. Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy?

*   **Forward Proxy:** Sit before the *Client*. Masks the Client ID. (e.g., VPN, Corporate Filter).
*   **Reverse Proxy:** Sit before the *Server*. Masks the Server ID. (e.g., Nginx, Load Balancer).

### 13. Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events (SSE).

| Feature | Polling (Short/Long) | WebSockets | SSE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | Client -> Server | Bidirectional | Server -> Client |
| **Connection** | New connection per request (Short) | Persistent TCP | Persistent HTTP |
| **Use Case** | Dashboards, low frequency | Chat, Gaming | News feeds, Stock Tickers |

### 14. LSM Tree vs B-Tree (Database Indexing).

*   **B-Tree:** (Used in SQL) Optimized for Reads. Data stored in sorted pages. Update in-place.
*   **LSM (Log-Structured Merge):** (Used in Cassandra, Kafka) Optimized for Writes. Appends to log, merges in background.

### 15. What are common Rate Limiting Algorithms?

1.  **Token Bucket:** Tokens added at rate `r`. Request consumes token. (Allows Bursts).
2.  **Leaky Bucket:** Requests enter queue, processed at constant rate. (Smooths traffic).
3.  **Fixed Window Counter:** Counter resets every minute. (Edge case: double bursts at boundary).
4.  **Sliding Window Log:** Precise, stores timestamps. (High memory).
5.  **Sliding Window Counter:** Hybrid approach.

### 16. Strong vs Eventual Consistency?

*   **Strong:** After a write, any subsequent read returns the new value. (High Latency).
*   **Eventual:** After a write, reads may return old value for a "window of inconsistency". (Low Latency).

### 17. What is a Heartbeat?

A periodic signal sent by a component to indicate it is alive and functioning. Used in Fail-over mechanisms.

### 18. What is a Checksum?

A small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage.

### 19. What is a Bloom Filter?

*   Never returns False Negative. Can return False Positive.
*   *Use Case:* Checking if a username is taken before hitting the DB.

### 20. What is Quorum?

The minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction has to obtain to be allowed to perform an operation in a distributed system.
*   `R + W > N` (Read nodes + Write nodes > Total nodes) guarantees strong consistency.

### 21. How does Leader Election work?

Process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task among several computers (nodes).
*   **Algorithms:** Paxos, Raft, Zookeeper (ZAB).

### 22. What is Idempotency?

An operation is idempotent if applying it multiple times has the same effect as applying it once.
*   `POST` is generally NOT idempotent.
*   `PUT` and `DELETE` ARE idempotent.
*   *Implementation:* Use a unique "Idempotency Key" in request headers.

### 23. What is Long-Polling?

1.  Client sends request.
2.  Server holds request open until data is available.
3.  Server sends response.
4.  Client immediately sends new request.

### 24. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks?

Decentralized network where each node acts as both client and server (peer).
*   *Pros:* High availability, no single point of failure.
*   *Cons:* Security, slower discovery (Gossip protocol).

### 25. What is Service Discovery?

How microservices locate each other on a network (IP + Port).
*   **Client-Side:** Client queries Service Registry (Netflix Eureka), then calls service.
*   **Server-Side:** Client calls Load Balancer (AWS ELB), LB queries Registry.


## Part 2: Distributed Systems & Data (26-50)

### 26. What is Database Partitioning (Sharding)?

Breaking up a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

**Methods:**
1.  **Horizontal Sharding:** Rows split by key (e.g., UserID 1-1000 in DB1).
2.  **Vertical Sharding:** Columns split by feature (e.g., User Profile in DB1, User Photos in DB2).
3.  **Directory Based:** Lookup table knows where data is.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Cross-shard joins.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "How do you handle a query that needs data from multiple shards?"
    *   *Answer:* Perform application-level joins or de-normalize data to avoid the join.

### 27. Master-Slave vs Master-Master Replication?

*   **Master-Slave:** Writes go to Master. Reads go to Slaves.
    *   *Pros:* Simple. Strong consistency on Master.
    *   *Cons:* Master is SPOF for writes. Replication lag.
*   **Master-Master:** Writes go to any Master.
    *   *Pros:* High availability for writes.

### 28. What is the Two-Phase Commit (2PC)?

A distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction.

1.  **Prepare Phase:** Coordinator asks "Can you commit?". Nodes lock resources and say "Yes".
2.  **Commit Phase:** If all "Yes", Coordinator says "Commit". Else "Rollback".

*   *Downside:* Blocking protocol. Slow.

### 29. What is Saga Pattern?

A sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes an event or message to trigger the next local transaction in the saga.
*   **Compensation:** If a step fails, execute compensating transactions to undo changes.

### 30. Explain "Split Brain" in distributed systems.

A condition where the network partitions, and two nodes both believe they are the Master/Leader. They both accept writes, leading to data corruption/divergence.
*   *Solution:* Quorum (Majority vote).

### 31. Row-Oriented vs Column-Oriented Databases?

*   **Row-Oriented (Postgres, MySQL):** Stores data by row. Efficient for writing/reading whole records (OLTP).

*   Don't need complex JOINS.

### 34. How does Redis persist data?

1.  **RDB (Snapshotting):** Saves point-in-time snapshots of dataset at intervals. (Fast restart, data loss possible).
2.  **AOF (Append Only File):** Logs every write operation. (Slower restart, higher durability).

### 35. What is a "Thundering Herd" problem?

A large number of processes/users waiting for an event occur simultaneously when the event happens (e.g., Cache Expiry). They all hit the database at once, crashing it.
*   *Solution:* Stagger expiration times (Jitter) or use a "Mutex" to let only one populate the cache.

### 36. What is "Backpressure"?

A feedback mechanism in data flow. If the consumer cannot keep up with the producer, it signals the producer to slow down.
*   *Without Backpressure:* Consumer runs out of memory (OOM) buffering incoming data.

### 37. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?

*   `PUT`: Replaces the *entire* resource. (Idempotent).
*   `PATCH`: Applies a *partial* update to the resource. (Not necessarily idempotent).

### 38. What is "Database Federation"?

Splitting data by function across multiple distinct databases (e.g., Forum DB, User DB, Product DB).
*   *Pros:* Less coupling.
*   *Cons:* No cross-DB joins.

### 39. Explain "Gossip Protocol".

*   *Use Case:* Yelp, Uber (Find nearby).

### 42. What is QuadTree?

A tree data structure where each internal node has exactly four children. Used to partition a two-dimensional space.
*   *Use Case:* Spatial indexing. Better than Geohash for non-uniform distribution of points.

### 43. Pull vs Push models in Monitoring/Metrics?

*   **Push (StatsD, Telegraf):** App sends metrics to collector.
    *   *Pros:* App controls frequency. Short-lived jobs supported.
*   **Pull (Prometheus):** Collector scrapes metrics endpoint on App.
    *   *Pros:* Central control. App doesn't need to know destination.

### 44. What is a "Circuit Breaker"?

A design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring.
*   **Closed:** Requests pass through.
*   **Open:** Requests fail immediately (after threshold of errors).

*   **Exactly-once:** Hardest to achieve (Kafka transactions).

### 46. What is "Compensating Transaction"?

In a distributed transaction (Saga), a transaction that undoes the effect of a previous transaction that had committed. (e.g., Refund money if Order fails).

### 47. Explain "Isolation Levels" in context of Distributed Systems.

*   **Read Uncommitted**
*   **Read Committed**
*   **Repeatable Read**
*   **Serializable**
*   *Snapshot Isolation:* Reads see a consistent snapshot of the DB from start of transaction.

### 48. What is "HyperLogLog"?

A probabilistic data structure used for estimating the cardinality (count of unique items) of a set.
*   Uses very little memory compared to storing all unique IDs.
*   *Use Case:* Count unique daily visitors (100M+).

### 49. What is "Tombstone" in deletion?

In systems like Cassandra (LSM), you cannot physically delete a row immediately (immutable files).
Instead, you write a "Tombstone" marker. The data is actually removed during Compaction.

### 50. File Storage vs Block Storage vs Object Storage?

*   **Symmetric:** Same key for encryption and decryption. (Fast).
*   **Asymmetric:** Public Key encrypts, Private Key decrypts. (Secure exchange, slower).
*   *HTTPS:* Uses Asymmetric to exchange a Symmetric key, then uses Symmetric for data.

### 62. What is SSL/TLS Handshake?

1.  Client Hello (I support TLS 1.2, Cipher Suites).
2.  Server Hello (Let's use TLS 1.2).
3.  Server sends Certificate (Public Key).

*   *Pros:* Pay per execution. No server management.
*   *Cons:* Cold starts. Vendor lock-in.

### 68. What is "Publisher/Subscriber" (Pub/Sub) pattern?

    *   12 bits: Sequence Number (per millisecond).

### 89. Design Key-Value Store (like DynamoDB).

*   **Partitioning:** Consistent Hashing.
*   **Replication:** Preference List (Top N nodes in ring).
*   **Consistency:** Tunable (W + R > N). Vector Clocks for versioning.
*   **Gossip:** For node membership.

### 90. Design Metrics Monitoring System (Datadog).

*   **Write Heavy:** Time Series Database (TSDB) like InfluxDB or Prometheus (internally Whisper/TSDB).
*   **Data Model:** Metric Name, Tags (Host, Region), Timestamp, Value.
*   **Downsampling:** Keep raw data for 7 days. Roll up to 1-min avg for 30 days. 1-hour avg for 1 year.

### 91. Design Leaderboard.

*   **Real-time:** Redis `Sorted Sets` (ZSET).
    *   `ZADD leaderboard <score> <user>`
    *   `ZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 9` (Top 10).
*   **Scale:** Shard by range of scores if too big? No, shard by UserID to update score, use Gatherer to merge top lists.

### 92. Design Payment System.

*   **Critical:** ACID, Idempotency, Audit Logs.
*   **Reconciliation:** Asynchronous process to compare DB records with Bank Statements.
*   **Double Entry Ledger:** Every transaction has a Debit and Credit. Sum must be zero.

### 93. Design a URL Crawler Cache/Proxy.

*   **Req:** Save bandwidth.
*   **Hashing:** Hash(URL) -> File Path.
*   **Expiry:** Check HTTP Headers (Cache-Control, ETag).

### 94. Design Amazon Shopping Cart.

*   **Availability:** Must never fail to add item.
*   **Consistency:** Eventual.
*   **Conflict:** Merging carts from different devices (Session vs Logged In). DynamoDB was built for this (Shopping Cart anomaly).

### 95. Design 'Nearby Friends'.

*   **Updates:** Sparse updates (only when moving significant distance).
*   **P2P:** Not viable for mobile.
*   **Server:** Ephemeral location history. Redis Geo.

### 96. Design Distributed Job Scheduler.

*   **Coordination:** Zookeeper/Etcd to elect Leader.
*   **Storage:** Tasks in DB.
*   **Execution:** Workers poll or Leader pushes to Kafka.
*   **Ack:** Worker acks upon completion. If timeout, re-queue.

### 97. Design 'Who Viewed Your Profile'.

*   **Volume:** High write volume.
*   **Async:** Push event to Kafka. Consumer aggregates in batch.
*   **Storage:** NoSQL (Wide Column). Key: `ProfileOwner_Date`, Col: `ViewerID`.

### 98. Design Collaborative Editor (Google Docs).

*   **Algorithm:** Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type).
*   **Communication:** WebSockets for real-time chars.

### 99. Design API Rate Limiter (Distributed).

*   **Problem:** Syncing counters across nodes is slow.
*   **Solution:** Sticky Sessions (Local memory) OR Redis (Centralized, but latency penalty). OR "Gossip" limit (approximate).

### 100. Design a Proximity Service (Yelp).

*   **Read/Write:** High Read (Search), Low Write (Business moves).
*   **Index:** Static QuadTree. Store in SQL or NoSQL.
*   **Search:** Find QuadTree node, search it + 8 neighbors.
