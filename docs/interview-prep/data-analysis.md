# Data Analysis Interview Questions & Answers (100+)

This guide contains 100+ Data Analysis interview questions, covering statistics, data cleaning, visualization, machine learning concepts, and business metrics. Each question includes a model answer and potential follow-up paths to explore the candidate's depth of understanding.

## Part 1: Statistics & Probability (1-20)

### 1. What is the difference between specific and sensitivity?

| Metric | Formula | Description | "Layman" Term |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sensitivity** (Recall) | $TP / (TP + FN)$ | Ability to correctly identify positive cases. | True Positive Rate |
| **Specificity** | $TN / (TN + FP)$ | Ability to correctly identify negative cases. | True Negative Rate |

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Medical Context.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "In a cancer screening test, would you prioritize sensitivity or specificity?"
    *   *Answer:* Sensitivity. You don't want to miss a positive case (False Negative). False Positives can be ruled out with further testing.
*   **Path B: Spam Filter Context.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "For a spam folder, which is more important?"
    *   *Answer:* Specificity. You don't want important emails (Ham) going to Spam (False Positive).

### 2. Explain the P-value to a non-technical stakeholder.

The P-value is the probability of seeing results *at least as extreme* as what we observed, assuming that nothing interesting is happening (the null hypothesis is true).

*   **Low P-value (< 0.05):** "This result is very surprising if there's no actual effect. We should probably reject the idea that nothing is happening."
*   **High P-value (> 0.05):** "This result could easily happen by random chance. We can't say for sure there's an effect."

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: "Probability the hypothesis is true".**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Is P=0.03 a 97% chance the alternative hypothesis is true?"
    *   *Answer:* No. It is a common misconception. It strictly refers to the data probability given the null hypothesis, $P(Data | H_0)$, not $P(H_1 | Data)$.

### 3. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?

The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a **Normal Distribution** as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d).

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Population (Any Shape)] --> B{Sampling}
    B --> C[Sample 1 Mean]
    B --> D[Sample 2 Mean]
    B --> E[Sample N Mean]
    C --> F[Distribution of Means]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)]
```

### 4. What is Type I vs Type II error?

| Error | Name | Description | Example (Fire Alarm) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | False Positive | Rejecting $H_0$ when it is true. | Alarm goes off, but no fire. |
| **Type II** | False Negative | Failing to reject $H_0$ when it is false. | Fire burning, but alarm stays silent. |

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Alpha and Beta.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What is the relationship between Type I error and Statistical Power?"
    *   *Answer:* Power = $1 - \beta$ (where $\beta$ is Type II error probability). Reducing Type I error ($\alpha$) usually increases Type II error ($\beta$) if sample size is fixed.

### 5. What is Simpson's Paradox?

A phenomenon where a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.

*Example:*
*   Hospital A has higher death rates than Hospital B overall.
*   However, Hospital A has *lower* death rates for "Poor Condition" patients AND "Good Condition" patients individually.
*   *Cause:* Hospital A takes in significantly more "Poor Condition" patients than B.

### 6. Explain the difference between Correlation and Causation.

Correlation measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Causation indicates that one variable *causes* the change in the other.
*   "Ice cream sales correlate with shark attacks." (Both caused by Summer/Heat).

### 7. What is selection bias?

Bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved.
*Example:* Polling people by landline phone excludes younger demographics who only use mobiles.

### 8. What is the Law of Large Numbers?

As the size of a sample increases, the sample mean gets closer to the expected value (population mean).

### 9. Describe the difference between a Normal and a Skewed distribution.

*   **Normal:** Symmetric, Bell-shaped. Mean = Median = Mode.
*   **Left Skewed (Negative):** Tail is on the left. Mean < Median < Mode.
*   **Right Skewed (Positive):** Tail is on the right. Mode < Median < Mean. (e.g., Income distribution).

### 10. How do you handle missing data?

1.  **Deletion:** Remove rows (Listwise) or columns. (Good if data is Missing Completely At Random - MCAR).
2.  **Imputation:**
    *   Mean/Median/Mode (Simple).
    *   KNN or Regression (Advanced).
3.  **Flagging:** Add a binary column `is_missing` to allow the model to learn the pattern.

### 11. What is R-squared?

$R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination) represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.
*   $R^2 = 1$: Perfect fit.
*   $R^2 = 0$: The model explains none of the variability.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: "Higher is better".**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Can a low R-squared be good?"
    *   *Answer:* Yes, in fields like psychology or human behavior, predicting specific outcomes is hard, but significant trends (coefficients) are still valuable.

### 12. What is Adjusted R-squared?

$R^2$ always increases (or stays same) when you add more predictors, even junk ones. **Adjusted $R^2$** penalizes the addition of useless predictors. It only increases if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance.

### 13. What is Confidence Interval?

A range of values, derived from sample statistics, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.
*   *Interpretation:* "If we repeated this sampling 100 times, 95 of the calculated intervals would contain the true population mean." (For a 95% CI).

### 14. What is A/B Testing?

A randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It involves the application of statistical hypothesis testing (like a t-test or z-test) to determine if the difference in outcomes is significant.

### 15. What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?

1.  **Linearity:** The relationship between X and Y is linear.
2.  **Independence:** Observations are independent.
3.  **Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance of errors.
4.  **Normality:** Errors are normally distributed.
5.  **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables are not highly correlated.

### 16. What is the difference between Probability and Likelihood?

*   **Probability:** Given a set of parameters (e.g., a fair coin), what is the chance of seeing the data (HHT)? $P(Data | \theta)$.
*   **Likelihood:** Given the data (HHT), how likely are different parameters (e.g., coin fairness $\theta$)? $L(\theta | Data)$.

### 17. What is Bayesian Inference?

A method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.
$Posterior \propto Likelihood \times Prior$

### 18. What is a Z-score?

A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.
$Z = (X - \mu) / \sigma$

### 19. When should you use a T-test vs a Z-test?

*   **Z-test:** When population variance ($\sigma^2$) is **known** and sample size is large ($n > 30$).
*   **T-test:** When population variance is **unknown** or sample size is small ($n < 30$).

### 20. What is a Box Plot (Box and Whisker)?

A standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary:
1.  Minimum
2.  First Quartile (Q1)
3.  Median
4.  Third Quartile (Q3)
5.  Maximum

**Chart: Box Plot Components**
```
      |----[  Q1  |  Q3  ]----|

```

## Part 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (21-40)

### 21. How do you detect outliers?

*   **Visual:** Box plots, Scatter plots.
*   **Z-Score:** Points with $Z > 3$ or $Z < -3$.
*   **IQR Method:** Points outside $1.5 \times IQR$ range (below $Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR$ or above $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$).

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Delete them.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "When should you NOT delete outliers?"
    *   *Answer:* When they are genuine data points (e.g., fraud detection, high-value customers). They might contain the most valuable signal.

### 22. What is One-Hot Encoding?

### 23. What is Label Encoding?

Converting each value in a column to a number.
*   Low, Medium, High -> 0, 1, 2.

### 24. How do you handle duplicate data?

1.  Identify unique keys (Primary Keys).
2.  Check if duplicates are exact copies or partial (same ID, different timestamp).

### 25. What is Scaling/Normalization?

Adjusting the range of features.
*   **Min-Max Scaling:** Rescales to [0, 1]. $X_{new} = (X - X_{min}) / (X_{max} - X_{min})$.
*   **Standardization (Z-score):** Center around 0 with std dev of 1.

### 26. Why do we need to scale data?

Algorithms that compute distances (KNN, K-Means, SVM) are sensitive to the scale of input features. If one feature ranges 0-1 and another 0-1000, the second will dominate the distance calculation.

### 27. What is Data Imputation bias?

When the method used to fill missing values distorts the data distribution.
*Example:* Filling missing "Age" with the Mean reduces the variance of the Age variable, making the population look more uniform than it is.

### 28. How do you parse non-standard date formats?

Using libraries like `pandas` (`to_datetime`) with format strings, or regex extraction for messy strings.
*   "2nd of Jan, 2021" -> `%d%S of %b, %Y` (Requires custom logic for ordinal suffixes).

### 29. What is "Tidy Data"?

2.  Each observation forms a row.
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### 30. How do you handle string data with inconsistent capitalization/spacing?

*   Standardize case (`.lower()`, `.upper()`).
*   Trim whitespace (`.strip()`).
*   Fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance) to group similar strings ("New York" vs "new york " vs "New  York").

### 31. What is the Curse of Dimensionality?

As the number of features (dimensions) increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data becomes sparse. This makes it problematic for any method that requires statistical significance (clustering, nearest neighbors).

### 32. What is Feature Engineering?

### 34. What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis)?

A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) features called Principal Components, retaining the maximum variance.

### 35. How do you handle highly correlated features (Multicollinearity)?

*   Remove one of the correlated pairs.
*   Use PCA to combine them.

### 39. What is SMOTE?

**Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique**.
Used for imbalanced datasets. It creates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing samples, rather than just duplicating them.

### 40. How do you validate that your data cleaning was successful?

*   **Sanity Checks:** Check ranges (Age < 0?), uniqueness (IDs), constraints.
*   **Summary Statistics:** Compare mean/distribution before and after (unless correction was the goal).
