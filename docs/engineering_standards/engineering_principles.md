# Engineering Principles

## Executive Summary
This document defines the engineering standard for **Engineering Principles**. Adherence is mandatory to ensure quality and maintainability.

## Core Standard
These principles guide our technical decision-making and culture. They are the
foundation of how we build software and systems.

## 1. Customer Obsession

Our primary goal is to deliver value to our customers. We work backwards from
the customer needs, ensuring that every line of code we write solves a real
problem.

## 2. Move Fast and Fix Things

Speed matters. We value rapid iteration and learning over perfect initial
execution. However, we also prioritize fixing broken things immediately. If the
build is broken, we stop and fix it. If an incident occurs, we resolve it and
learn from it.

## 3. Operational Excellence

We are responsible for the code we write in production. "You build it, you run
it." We prioritize observability, reliability, and security from day one, not as
an afterthought.

## 4. Disagree and Commit

Healthy debate is essential for good decision-making. We encourage diverse
perspectives and challenging assumptions. However, once a decision is made, we
commit fully to its success, regardless of our initial position.

## 5. Simplicity Over Complexity

Complexity is the enemy of reliability and speed. We strive for simple,
understandable, and maintainable solutions. We avoid over-engineering and
premature optimization.

## 6. Automate Everything

Manual toil scales linearly with growth; automation scales effectively. We
invest time in automating repetitive tasks, testing, and deployments to free up
time for creative problem-solving.

## 7. Security First

Security is everyone's responsibility. We design systems with security in mind,
adhering to the principle of least privilege and practicing defense in depth.

## 8. Data-Driven Decisions

We rely on data, metrics, and evidence to guide our decisions, rather than
opinions or intuition. We measure what matters and use that data to improve our
systems and processes.

## Best Practices
*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
*   **Readability:** Write code for humans first, computers second.
*   **Testing:** All changes must be verified with tests.

## Review Process
*   All changes related to this standard must be reviewed by a peer.
