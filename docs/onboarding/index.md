## Welcome to the Team

We are thrilled to have you join us. This onboarding guide is designed to help
you settle in, understand our culture, and get up to speed quickly.

### Onboarding Resources

* [**Checklists**](checklist.md): Step-by-step guides for your first day,
  week, and month.
* [**Engineering Bootcamp**](engineering_bootcamp.md): Specific setup and
  guides for engineering roles.
* [**Culture and Values**](culture_and_values.md): Learn about our mission,
  values, and how we work.
* [**Tools and Access**](tools_and_access.md): How to get access to the tools
  you need.

### Getting Started

Your first few days will be a whirlwind of new faces and information. Don't
worry about memorizing everything. Focus on meeting your team, setting up your
environment, and asking questions.

We believe in **learning by doing**. The best way to understand our systems is
to jump in.

If you have any questions, reach out to your manager or your onboarding buddy.

Welcome aboard!
