# Culture and Values

## Welcome!
Welcome to the team! This guide covers **Culture and Values** as part of your onboarding journey.

## Key Information
## Culture and Values

At our company, culture isn't just a poster on the wall; it's how we make
decisions, how we treat each other, and how we get work done.

### Our Mission

> **To build the future of software development.**

We exist to empower developers and teams to build better software, faster.

### Core Values

#### 1. Customer Obsession

We start with the customer and work backward. We work vigorously to earn and
keep customer trust. Although we pay attention to competitors, we obsess over
customers.

#### 2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value
for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just
their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

#### 3. Move Fast and Break Things (Responsibly)

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not
need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. However, we also value
stability and reliability for our core infrastructure.

#### 4. Be Radical, Be Candid

We value direct, honest feedback. We challenge ideas, not people. We believe
that robust debate leads to better outcomes.

#### 5. Hire and Develop the Best

We raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. We recognize
exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization.
Leaders develop leaders and take their role in coaching seriously.

### Operating Principles

* **Transparency**: Default to open. Share information broadly unless there is
  a compelling reason not to.
* **Asynchronous First**: We document everything. Writing is thinking. We
  prefer written communication over meetings whenever possible.
* **Focus**: We say "no" to many good ideas so we can focus on the few truly
  great ones.
* **Data-Driven**: We use data to inform our decisions, but we also trust our
  intuition and experience when data is scarce.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

We are committed to building a diverse team and an inclusive environment where
everyone feels they belong. We believe that diverse teams build better
products.
