## Tools and Access

Here is a list of the primary tools we use and how to get access to them.

### Access Provisioning

Most access is provisioned automatically via Okta (Single Sign-On) on your
first day. If you are missing access to a specific tool, file a ticket in the
**IT Helpdesk** Jira project.

### Core Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Slack** | Communication | Auto-provisioned. |
| **Google Workspace** | Email, Calendar, Drive | Auto-provisioned. |
| **Zoom** | Video conferencing | Auto-provisioned. |
| **Okta** | SSO dashboard | Gateway to everything. |
| **Jira** | Project management | Request from manager. |
| **Confluence** | Knowledge base | Request from manager. |
| **GitHub** | Source code | Add username to HR profile. |

### Engineering Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS / GCP** | Cloud Infrastructure | Request via IT Helpdesk. |
| **Datadog / Splunk** | Monitoring & Logging | SSO enabled. |
| **PagerDuty** | Incident Management | Ask manager to add to schedule. |
| **Sentry** | Error Tracking | SSO enabled. |
| **Figma** | Design files (View) | SSO enabled. |

### Requesting New Software

If you need software that is not on this list:

1. Check the **Software Catalog** in the IT portal.
2. If not listed, submit a **New Software Request** form.
3. Approvals from your Manager and IT Security are required.

### Security Best Practices

* **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication is required for all services.
* **Password Manager**: Use 1Password to generate and store secure passwords.
* **Phishing**: Be vigilant. Report suspicious emails to `security@company.com`.
