# Remote and Hybrid Work Policy

## Purpose
This policy outlines the guidelines for remote and hybrid work arrangements to ensure productivity, collaboration, and work-life balance.

## Eligibility
All full-time employees are eligible for hybrid work, subject to role requirements and manager approval.

## Work Arrangements
1.  **Fully Remote**: Employees work from a location of their choice 100% of the time.
2.  **Hybrid**: Employees split their time between the office and a remote location (e.g., 3 days in office, 2 days remote).
3.  **Office-Based**: Employees work from the company office 100% of the time.

## Expectations
*   **Availability**: Employees must be available during core business hours (10:00 AM - 4:00 PM).
*   **Communication**: Maintain regular communication with your team and manager via Slack, Zoom, and email.
*   **Equipment**: The company will provide necessary equipment (laptop, monitor, etc.) for remote work.
*   **Security**: Follow all information security policies when working remotely, including using a VPN.

## Expenses
The company may reimburse reasonable expenses related to remote work, such as internet costs, subject to approval.
