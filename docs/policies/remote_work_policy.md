## Remote and Hybrid Work Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024 **Owner:** People Operations (HR) **Applies
To:** All Full-Time Employees

## 1. Purpose & Philosophy

At our company, we believe that work is what you do, not where you go. We are
committed to a flexible work environment that empowers employees to choose the
setting where they are most productive. This policy outlines the guidelines,
expectations, and support structures for remote and hybrid work.

Our goal is to balance individual flexibility with the need for high-performance
collaboration. We trust our employees to manage their time and output, while
maintaining the strong cultural bonds that define us.

## 2. Work Arrangements

We offer three primary work arrangements. Employees select their preferred mode
in consultation with their manager during onboarding or typically during the
annual review cycle.

### 2.1. Fully Remote

- **Definition:** The employee works from a location of their choice (typically
  their home) 100% of the time. They do not have an assigned desk at a company
  office.
- **Expectation:** The employee must reside in a jurisdiction where the company
  is legally authorized to employ staff (see Section 6: Geography). They may be
  required to travel to the office for quarterly planning or team offsites.

### 2.2. Hybrid

- **Definition:** The employee splits their time between a company office and a
  remote location.
- **Typical Schedule:** 3 days in office (Tue/Wed/Thu), 2 days remote (Mon/Fri).
  This "Anchor Days" model ensures that when people are in the office, their
  teammates are too.
- **Desk:** Depending on office capacity, hybrid employees may have a dedicated
  desk or use a "hot desk" reservation system.

### 2.3. Office-Based

- **Definition:** The employee works from the company office 4-5 days a week.
- **Requirement:** Some roles (e.g., Office Manager, Hardware Lab Engineer) may
  require this designation due to the physical nature of the work.

## 3. Expectations & Guidelines

Flexibility comes with responsibility. Regardless of location, all employees are
held to the same standards of performance and professionalism.

### 3.1. Availability & Hours

- **Core Hours:** To facilitate synchronous collaboration, all employees
  (regardless of time zone) are expected to be available during "Core Hours" of
  **10:00 AM to 2:00 PM Pacific Time** (or the relevant hub timezone).
- **Flexibility:** Outside of core hours, employees may structure their day as
  they see fit, provided they meet their deadlines and attend scheduled
  meetings.
- **Responsiveness:** During working hours, employees should be responsive on
  Slack and email. If stepping away for an extended period (e.g., > 1 hour),
  update your Slack status.

### 3.2. Workspace Requirements

Employees working remotely must ensure they have a suitable environment:

- **High-Speed Internet:** A stable connection capable of supporting video calls
  (minimum 50 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up).
- **Private Area:** A quiet space where confidential discussions can take place
  without interruption or eavesdropping.
- **Ergonomics:** A desk and chair that support healthy posture. (See Section 5
  for stipends).

### 3.3. Communication

Remote work requires "over-communication."

- **Video On:** For team meetings and 1:1s, we encourage cameras on to foster
  connection.
- **Async First:** Default to writing. Use documentation, recorded updates
  (Loom), and public Slack channels instead of private DMs or unnecessary
  meetings.
- **Calendar Etiquette:** Keep your Google Calendar up to date. Mark "Focus
  Time" and "Out of Office" blocks clearly.

## 4. Security & Data Privacy

Remote work introduces unique security risks. Employees must strictly adhere to
the [Information Security Policy](/policies/information_security_policy/).

- **VPN:** Always use the corporate VPN (Cisco AnyConnect) when accessing
  internal tools or working from public Wi-Fi (e.g., cafes, airports).
- **Device Management:** Only do company work on company-issued devices (MDM
  managed). Do not use personal tablets or computers for accessing sensitive
  customer data.
- **Physical Security:** Do not leave your laptop unlocked or unattended in
  public spaces. Use a privacy screen filter when traveling.
- **Confidentiality:** Be aware of your surroundings. Do not discuss sensitive
  company information in public places where you can be overheard.

## 5. Equipment & Stipends

We invest in your productivity.

### 5.1. Company-Issued Equipment

All employees receive:

- Laptop (MacBook Pro M3 or Dell XPS)
- Monitor (27" 4K)
- Peripherals (Keyboard, Mouse, Headset, Webcam)

### 5.2. Remote Work Stipend

- **Initial Setup:** A one-time stipend of **$1,000 (USD)** upon hire to
  purchase a desk, chair, or office supplies.
- **Monthly Allowance:** A monthly stipend of **$75 (USD)** to cover internet
  and electricity costs. This is processed via payroll.
- **Travel:** For fully remote employees, the company covers travel, lodging,
  and meals for required onsite visits (e.g., quarterly offsites).

## 6. Geographic & Legal Considerations

- **Authorized Locations:** You may work from any state/country where we have a
  legal entity or PEO (Professional Employer Organization) relationship.
- **Relocation:** You must notify HR _before_ moving to a new city or state.
  Relocation may impact your compensation (based on cost-of-labor zones) and tax
  withholdings.
- **Digital Nomadism:** Working temporarily from a different location is allowed
  for up to 30 days per year, provided you maintain core hours and reliable
  internet. Longer stays require HR approval due to potential tax nexus
  implications.

## 7. Health & Wellness

Remote work can blur the lines between home and office. We encourage you to:

- **Set Boundaries:** "Turn off" work at the end of the day. Snooze Slack
  notifications.
- **Take Breaks:** Step away from the screen. Go for a walk.
- **Mental Health:** Utilize our EAP (Employee Assistance Program) and mental
  health benefits (e.g., Headspace subscription) if you feel isolated or burnt
  out.

## 8. Policy Violations

Failure to adhere to these guidelines (e.g., consistent unavailability during
core hours, security lapses, unauthorized relocation) may result in the
revocation of remote work privileges or disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
