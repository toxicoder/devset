# Remote Work & Hybrid Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Owner:** People Operations
**Audience:** All Employees

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

Our organization operates on a **Hybrid** work model. We believe in the power of in-person collaboration *and* the flexibility of remote focus. We do not view these as opposing forces, but as complementary tools in our productivity arsenal.

### The "Best of Both Worlds" Mindset
*   **The Office is for Collaboration:** We use our physical spaces for brainstorming, whiteboarding, complex problem solving, and social bonding. The office is a "tool," not just a place to sit.
*   **Home is for Focus:** We respect that deep work often happens best in a quiet, controlled environment. Remote days are optimized for execution and "heads-down" time.
*   **Intentionality:** We don't come to the office just to sit on Zoom calls. We structure our weeks to maximize the value of both environments.

## 2. The Hybrid Model: 3+2

### Standard Schedule
Our standard cadence is **3 days in the office** and **2 days remote**.
*   **Anchor Days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday):** These are mandatory in-office days. We synchronize our schedules to ensure that when you are in the office, your team is too.
*   **Flex Days (Monday, Friday):** These are optional remote days. You may work from home or the office.

### Rationale: Why Anchor Days?
Research and internal data show that unplanned hybrid schedules (where employees choose any 3 days) result in "ghost towns" and frustrated collaboration. By synchronizing our Anchor Days:
1.  **Maximize Overlap:** We ensure critical mass for meetings and spontaneous interactions.
2.  **Minimize FOMO:** You don't worry about missing an important hallway conversation.
3.  **Predictability:** It simplifies meeting scheduling and resource planning (catering, etc.).

## 3. Eligibility & Exceptions

### Who is Eligible?
*   **Hybrid-Eligible Roles:** Most Knowledge Worker roles (Engineering, Product, Marketing, Sales, Finance).
*   **Office-Essential Roles:** Roles requiring physical presence (e.g., Office Manager, IT Support, Hardware Engineering, Lab Technicians). These roles are 100% on-site.
*   **Remote-Exceptional Roles:** Rare cases where specialized talent is hired outside of a hub radius. Requires VP-level approval.

### Geographic Radius
*   Employees in Hybrid roles must live within a **commutable distance** (typically <50 miles or <90 minutes door-to-door) of an assigned office hub.

## 4. Work Environment Guidelines

### In-Office Expectations
*   **Hours:** Core hours are 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. We expect you to be physically present during this window on Anchor Days.
*   **Desk Usage:** We utilize a "Hot Desking" or "Neighborhood" system. Teams have assigned zones, but individual desks are bookable.
*   **Meeting Etiquette:** If 3 people are in a room and 1 is remote, *everyone* should join the Zoom call individually (audio muted) or use the "Smart Room" hardware to ensure the remote person feels included.

### Remote Office Requirements
When working remotely (Mon/Fri), you are still "at work."
*   **Connectivity:** High-speed internet (Minimum 100 Mbps Down / 20 Mbps Up).
*   **Availability:** You must be reachable via Slack/Teams/Phone during core business hours.
*   **Environment:** A quiet, private space suitable for video calls. Working from a noisy cafe is discouraged for sensitive meetings.

## 5. Equipment & Stipends

We invest in your productivity, wherever you are.

### The "Hybrid Kit"
We provide equipment to ensure seamless transition between home and office.
*   **Laptop:** High-spec laptop (MacBook Pro or Dell XPS).
*   **Backpack:** High-quality commuter backpack.
*   **Chargers:** Two sets of chargers (one for home, one for office) to reduce carry weight.

### Home Office Stipend
*   **Initial Setup:** A one-time stipend of **$500 (USD)** is provided to upgrade your home monitor or chair.
*   **Recurring:** We do *not* provide a monthly internet stipend for Hybrid employees, as the office is the primary work location. (Remote-Exceptional employees receive a separate package).

---

## 6. Communication & Collaboration

Hybrid work requires distinct communication protocols.

### Asynchronous First
Even with Anchor Days, we default to writing.
*   **Documentation:** Decisions made in-person must be documented in Confluence/Notion. "If it's not written down, it didn't happen."
*   **Status Updates:** Daily standups may be async (Slack text) on Flex Days and sync (Zoom/In-person) on Anchor Days.

### The "One Remote, All Remote" Rule
If a meeting has mixed attendance (some in-room, some remote):
1.  **Video On:** Everyone turns their camera on.
2.  **Digital Whiteboard:** Use FigJam or Miro instead of a physical whiteboard so remote participants can contribute.
3.  **Inclusive Facilitation:** The meeting lead explicitly asks remote participants for input first.

### Availability Indicators
*   **Slack Status:** Use custom statuses to indicate location (🏢 In Office, 🏠 Remote, 🚌 Commuting).
*   **Calendar:** Block out commute times if you are traveling during working hours (e.g., leaving early to finish the day from home).

---

## 7. Security & Data Protection

### Commuting Security
*   **Device Transport:** Laptops must be fully shut down (not just sleep mode) and encrypted (FileVault/BitLocker) during transport.
*   **Privacy Screens:** Use privacy filters if working on the train or bus.
*   **Theft:** Do not leave bags unattended in cars or public transit.

### Network Security
*   **VPN:** Mandatory when accessing internal resources from home or public Wi-Fi.
*   **Smart Home Devices:** We recommend isolating work devices from insecure smart home/IoT devices (Guest Network) at home.

---

## 8. Health, Wellness & The "Right to Disconnect"

Hybrid work can blur the lines between work and life. We fight burnout aggressively.

### Disconnection
*   **No Expectation:** You are NOT expected to respond to emails/Slack after hours (e.g., after 6 PM or on weekends), regardless of where you worked that day.
*   **Scheduled Send:** Managers should use "Schedule Send" for late-night messages to arrive the next morning.

### Sick Policy
*   **Sick = Sick:** If you are contagious or feeling unwell, **do not come to the office**.
*   **Working While Sick?** If you are mildly ill but want to work, stay home (convert Anchor Day to Remote Day). If you are too sick to work, take a Sick Day. **Do not power through.**

---

## 9. Relocation & "Workcations"

### Relocation
*   Moving outside the commutable radius of your assigned hub changes your eligibility for a Hybrid role.
*   This must be discussed with HR *before* moving. It may require a role change, compensation adjustment, or separation if the role is strictly Office-Essential.

### Temporary "Workcations"
*   Employees may work fully remotely for up to **2 weeks per year** from a different location (e.g., visiting family) with Manager approval.
*   Time zone overlap requirements remain in effect.

---

## 10. Performance Management

We measure **impact**, not face time.

*   **Office Presence:** While we track badge swipes for capacity planning, we do not use it as a primary performance metric unless absenteeism becomes a pattern.
*   **Output:** Are you delivering on your OKRs?
*   **Collaboration:** Are you a good teammate? Do you contribute to the office culture?

## 11. FAQ

**Q: Can I swap my Anchor Days?**
A: Generally, no. The value comes from the *collective* presence. Exceptions can be made for doctor's appointments or home repairs, but the default is Tu/Wed/Thu.

**Q: What if I have a cold?**
A: Stay home. Work remotely if you feel up to it, or take a sick day. Do not bring germs to the office.

**Q: Can I work from a coffee shop on Flex Days?**
A: Yes, provided you follow security protocols (VPN) and have a quiet environment for calls.

**Q: Do I get a stipend for lunch on Anchor Days?**
A: The company provides catered lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Wednesday is "Team Lunch" day (often expensed, check team budget).
