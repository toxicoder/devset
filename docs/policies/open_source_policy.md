# Open Source Policy

## Purpose
This policy governs the use of open source software and contributions to open source projects.

## Using Open Source
*   **Approval**: Use of open source libraries must be approved by the Engineering Team.
*   **Licenses**: Only permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) are generally allowed. Copyleft licenses (e.g., GPL) require legal review.

## Contributing to Open Source
*   **Company Projects**: Employees are encouraged to contribute to Company-owned open source projects.
*   **Third-Party Projects**: Contributions to third-party projects must be approved by a manager and must not include proprietary information.

## Releasing Open Source
*   Releasing new open source projects requires approval from the Open Source Review Board.
