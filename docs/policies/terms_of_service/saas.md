Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees are based on Service tiers purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term.

Customer grants us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into our services any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction, or other feedback provided by Customer or Users relating to the operation of our services.

## 6. Confidentiality

### 6.1 Definition of Confidential Information
"Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.

### 6.2 Protection of Confidential Information
The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement.

## 7. Term and Termination

This Agreement commences on the date Customer first accepts it and continues until all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been terminated.

### 7.2 Termination
A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon 30 days written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.

## 8. Indemnification

We will defend Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that the use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE.
