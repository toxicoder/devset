# Whistleblower Policy

## 1. Purpose
The Company is committed to high standards of ethical, moral, and legal business conduct. The purpose of this policy is to encourage employees and others to report any suspected wrongdoing within the Company without fear of retaliation.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, board members, volunteers, contractors, and stakeholders of the Company.

## 3. Reporting Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all employees to report concerns about violations of the Company's Code of Conduct or suspected violations of laws or regulations that govern the Company's operations.

## 4. What to Report
Examples of reportable conduct include, but are not limited to:
*   Fraud or financial misappropriation.
*   Violations of federal, state, or local laws.
*   Unethical business conduct.
*   Health and safety violations.
*   Harassment or discrimination.
*   Attempted concealment of any of the above.

## 5. No Retaliation
No director, officer, or employee who in good faith reports a violation shall suffer harassment, retaliation, or adverse employment consequence. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.

## 6. Reporting Procedure
*   **Direct Reporting**: Employees are encouraged to share their questions, concerns, suggestions, or complaints with someone who can address them properly. In most cases, an employee’s supervisor is in the best position to address an area of concern.
*   **Compliance Officer**: If you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not satisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with the Compliance Officer or HR Director.
*   **Anonymous Reporting**: Reports may be made anonymously by sending a letter to the Compliance Officer or using the Company's anonymous ethics hotline/web portal.

## 7. Investigation
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation. The Company will protect the confidentiality of the whistleblower to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.
