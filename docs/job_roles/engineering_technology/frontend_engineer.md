# Frontend Engineer

**Role Code:** SWEN1003

## Job Description
A creative and technical role dedicated to building intuitive and responsive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. The Frontend Engineer translates design mockups into high-quality code, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers. They optimize application performance, manage application state, and ensure accessibility standards are met. This role requires close collaboration with designers and backend engineers to bring product visions to life.

## Responsibilities

*   **UI Component Implementation:** Translate high-fidelity design mockups from tools like Figma into pixel-perfect, reusable, and responsive UI components using modern frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular. You will ensure that these components adhere to the established design system and are implemented with semantic HTML and maintainable CSS (or CSS-in-JS). This involves handling various states (loading, error, empty) and edge cases to provide a robust user experience. You must also ensure that components are responsive across a wide range of devices and viewport sizes. Collaboration with designers is constant to clarify behaviors and animations.
*   **State Management Architecture:** Design and implement efficient strategies for managing application state, utilizing libraries like Redux, Context API, Zustand, or MobX. You will decide when to use local versus global state and how to propagate data through the component tree without causing unnecessary re-renders. This includes managing server state with tools like React Query or SWR to handle caching, synchronization, and background updates. You must ensure that the state logic is testable, predictable, and scalable as the application grows. Debugging complex state issues using devtools is a regular part of this responsibility.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Continuously monitor and improve the performance of the frontend application, focusing on Core Web Vitals such as LCP, FID, and CLS. You will implement techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to minimize bundle sizes and reduce initial load times. Optimizing rendering cycles to prevent jank and ensure 60fps animations is crucial for a smooth user experience. You will use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and memory leaks in the browser. You also optimize asset loading, including images and fonts, to respect user bandwidth.
*   **Accessibility (a11y) Compliance:** Ensure that all web applications are accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This involves using proper ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and managing focus for keyboard navigation. You will regularly test applications using screen readers (like NVDA or VoiceOver) and automated accessibility audit tools. Educating other team members on inclusive design patterns is often required. You champion the idea that the web is for everyone and that accessibility is not an afterthought.
*   **Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility:** Verify that the application functions correctly and looks consistent across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and operating systems. You will debug and resolve browser-specific rendering issues or JavaScript quirks, often utilizing polyfills or transpilation where necessary. Testing on real devices, not just simulators, is essential to catch touch-related bugs and layout shifts on mobile screens. You must balance the use of cutting-edge features with the need to support the defined browser support matrix.
*   **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress or Playwright. You will ensure that critical user flows are automated and that regressions are caught before they reach production. Adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices where appropriate to drive code design is encouraged. You also participate in visual regression testing to ensure that UI changes are intentional. Maintaining a high level of code coverage gives the team confidence to refactor and ship often.
*   **Design System Maintenance:** Contribute to the development and maintenance of a shared component library or design system that serves as the foundation for all frontend products. You will document component usage, props, and variations using tools like Storybook to facilitate adoption by other engineers. This involves balancing flexibility with consistency to meet the needs of different product teams. You will also manage versioning and breaking changes carefully to avoid disrupting consumers of the library.
*   **API Integration and Data Handling:** collaborate with backend engineers to define API contracts and integrate RESTful or GraphQL endpoints into the frontend application. You will handle data fetching, serialization, error handling, and validation logic on the client side. Implementing optimistic UI updates to make the application feel faster and more responsive is a key technique. You must also handle authentication flows (JWT, OAuth) and manage user sessions securely.
*   **Build Tooling and CI/CD:** Configure and optimize modern build tools and bundlers such as Webpack, Vite, or Rollup to streamline the development workflow. You will maintain the frontend CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that linting, formatting (Prettier/ESLint), and tests run automatically on every commit. Improving build times and hot module replacement (HMR) performance directly impacts developer productivity. You also manage dependency upgrades and resolve security vulnerabilities in npm packages.
*   **Code Review and Mentorship:** Participate actively in code reviews, providing constructive feedback on logic, style, and accessibility to peers. You will set and enforce coding standards to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. Mentoring junior engineers on frontend best practices, architectural patterns, and debugging techniques is a vital part of growing the team's capabilities. You also facilitate knowledge sharing sessions to discuss new web technologies and trends.

### Example Phrases
*   **Optimistic UI Proposal:** "The user feedback on this interaction needs to be snappier; let's add an optimistic UI update. Instead of waiting for the server to respond before showing the 'liked' state, we can toggle it immediately and revert it only if the request fails. This makes the application feel instant and responsive, significantly improving the perceived performance for the user. We just need to handle the rollback case gracefully."
*   **Layout Shift Concern:** "I'm worried about the cumulative layout shift (CLS) on mobile; we need to reserve space for these images before they load. Currently, the text jumps around as the images pop in, which is a poor user experience and hurts our SEO score. By adding explicit `width` and `height` attributes or an aspect-ratio container, we can preserve the layout structure. This will keep the reading experience stable."
*   **Keyboard Navigation Check:** "Does this component support keyboard navigation? I can't tab to the close button in this modal. For a user relying on a keyboard or assistive technology, this creates a 'keyboard trap' where they cannot exit the dialog. We need to manage focus properly, ensuring it moves to the modal when opened and returns to the trigger when closed. We also need to implement the 'Escape' key listener."
*   **Virtualization Recommendation:** "We should use a virtual list (windowing) here because rendering 10,000 DOM nodes is freezing the main thread. The browser struggles to recalculate styles and layout for that many elements at once, leading to significant lag. By only rendering the items currently visible in the viewport, we can keep the DOM size constant and scrolling smooth. Libraries like `react-window` make this easy to implement."
*   **Contrast Compliance:** "The contrast ratio on this button is only 3:1; we need to darken the background to meet the WCAG AA standard of 4.5:1. Low contrast makes the text difficult to read for users with visual impairments or those using their screens in bright sunlight. I'll adjust the color palette in the design tokens so this fix propagates everywhere this color is used. It's a small change that makes a big difference in usability."
*   **Lazy Loading Strategy:** "Let's lazy load this heavy chart library so it doesn't block the initial page paint. This component is only visible below the fold, so there's no need to download and parse its JavaScript immediately. We can use dynamic imports to fetch the bundle only when the user scrolls near that section. This will significantly improve our First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric."
*   **Re-render Optimization:** "I noticed a re-render loop in this component; we need to memoize these callback functions using `useCallback`. Every time the parent component renders, it's creating a new function reference, causing this heavy child component to re-render unnecessarily. By stabilizing the function reference, we can prevent this wasted work. We should also verify the dependency array is correct."
*   **Logic Extraction:** "This logic belongs in a custom hook, not inside the view component. The component is becoming too large and hard to read because it's handling data fetching, validation, and transformation all at once. By extracting this into a `useUserData` hook, we make the logic reusable and the component purely focused on presentation. It also makes unit testing the logic much easier."
*   **Alt Text Requirement:** "We need to ensure all our images have meaningful `alt` text for screen reader users. An empty or missing alt tag means a blind user has no context for what the image conveys. If the image is purely decorative, we should explicitly set `alt=""` so screen readers ignore it. For this product image, the text should describe the visual details relevant to the customer."
*   **Concurrent Features:** "Let's upgrade to the latest version of React to take advantage of the new concurrent features like Transitions. This will allow us to mark non-urgent state updates, like filtering a large list, as lower priority. This keeps the interface responsive to user input, like typing in the search bar, while the heavy work happens in the background. It's a huge win for perceived performance."
