*   **The Platform Manager:** Manages an infrastructure or platform team. Their "product" is internal developer tooling. Their stakeholders are other engineers.
*   **The Product Manager:** (Confusing title, but distinct role) Sometimes EMs act almost like PMs in technically complex domains (e.g., API teams).
*   **The Remote Manager:** Specializes in managing distributed teams. Focuses on async communication and documentation.
*   **The Mentor Manager:** Focuses on hiring junior talent and training them up. Their team is a "bootcamp" for the rest of the org.

*   **01:00 PM - Sprint Planning:** Join the team and the PM for sprint planning. I help the team push back on an unrealistic timeline. I ensure that we have allocated time for bug fixes.
*   **02:30 PM - 1:1 with Junior Engineer:** They are struggling with a complex task. I ask coaching questions to help them unstuck themselves without giving them the answer. I reassure them that it's okay to ask for help.

*   **Shielding:** "I'll handle the politics; you just write the code. The executives are debating the roadmap, but that doesn't need to distract you right now. I'll let you know once a decision is made. Keep your head down and focus on the current feature."
*   **Career Growth:** "Let's look at the career ladder to see what you need for the next level. You're doing great on the technical execution, but for Senior Engineer, I'd like to see you take more ownership of cross-team collaboration. Let's find a project where you can lead that."

*   **Pragmatism:** "I know we want to refactor this entire module, but we have a hard deadline for the marketing launch. Let's do a targeted fix now and add a ticket to the tech debt backlog to do the full refactor next sprint."
