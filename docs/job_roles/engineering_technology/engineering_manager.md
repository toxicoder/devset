# Engineering Manager

**Role Code:** SWEN0005

## Role Overview

The **Engineering Manager (EM)** is the linchpin of our engineering organization. This role is a unique blend of technical leadership, people management, and project execution. As an EM, you are responsible for the health, happiness, and productivity of a squad of engineers (typically 5-10 direct reports). You are not just a supervisor; you are a coach, a strategist, and a force multiplier.

While you may write less code than an Individual Contributor (IC), your technical judgment is crucial. You must be able to evaluate architectural trade-offs, assess technical debt, and ensure the team is building scalable, maintainable systems. You bridge the gap between business objectives and technical implementation, translating "what we need to build" into "how we will build it."

Your success is not measured by your own output, but by the output and growth of your team. You are expected to build a high-performing, inclusive culture where engineers can do the best work of their careers.

## Responsibilities

### People Management & Leadership
*   **Career Development:** Conduct regular 1:1 meetings with direct reports to discuss their career goals, provide feedback, and identify growth opportunities. You create personalized growth plans and champion your reports for promotions when they are ready.
*   **Performance Management:** Set clear expectations and goals (OKRs) for your team members. Provide continuous, actionable feedback—both positive and constructive. Handle performance reviews and, when necessary, performance improvement plans (PIPs) with empathy and fairness.
*   **Hiring & Onboarding:** Actively participate in the recruiting process. You source candidates, conduct interviews, and close offers. You own the onboarding experience for new hires, ensuring they have the tools, knowledge, and relationships to succeed from day one.
*   **Culture Building:** Foster a psychologically safe environment where team members feel comfortable taking risks, admitting mistakes, and sharing diverse perspectives. You resolve conflicts quickly and constructively. You organize team-building activities and celebrate wins.

### Technical Strategy & Execution
*   **Delivery Management:** Accountable for the team's delivery. You work with Product Managers to plan sprints, estimate efforts, and manage the backlog. You track team velocity and metrics (Cycle Time, Deployment Frequency) to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
*   **Technical Direction:** Although you delegate detailed design to Staff/Senior Engineers, you guide the high-level technical strategy. You ensure architectural decisions align with broader organizational standards. You ask the hard questions during design reviews.
*   **Operational Excellence:** Champion reliability and quality. You ensure the team balances feature work with technical debt reduction and maintenance. You oversee the team's on-call rotation health and ensure post-mortems lead to systemic improvements.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Manage the team's capacity. You protect the team from burnout by pushing back on unrealistic deadlines or scope creep. You ensure the team is working on the highest-leverage activities.

### Strategic Alignment
*   **Stakeholder Management:** Partner closely with Product Management and Design to define the product roadmap. You negotiate scope and timelines, communicating risks and trade-offs to leadership. You act as the "API" for your team to the rest of the organization.
*   **Organizational Growth:** Contribute to the broader engineering management community. You participate in working groups to improve hiring processes, career ladders, or technical standards. You share learnings and best practices with other EMs.

## Engineering Management Archetypes

While every EM needs a baseline of skills, different teams require different "flavors" of management.

1.  **The Tech Lead Manager (TLM):**
    *   **Context:** Small teams (3-5 engineers) or early-stage products.
    *   **Focus:** Splits time between coding/architecture (30-50%) and management. deeply involved in technical details.
2.  **The Team Builder:**
    *   **Context:** Rapidly growing teams or new initiatives.
    *   **Focus:** Heavy focus on hiring, onboarding, and establishing culture/process from scratch.
3.  **The Turnaround Specialist:**
    *   **Context:** Teams with low morale, high attrition, or missed deadlines.
    *   **Focus:** Rebuilding trust, fixing broken processes, and establishing stability.
4.  **The Organizational Leader:**
    *   **Context:** Large, mature teams or "Manager of Managers" track.
    *   **Focus:** Organizational design, cross-departmental strategy, and mentoring other leaders.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

How do we measure success for an Engineering Manager?

1.  **Team Health:** Measured via engagement surveys (e.g., Culture Amp). High retention rates and positive sentiment.
2.  **Delivery Predictability:** The team consistently meets its sprint commitments and delivers on the roadmap.
3.  **Operational Metrics:** System stability (uptime), incident response time (MTTR), and build pipeline health.
4.  **Hiring Velocity:** Ability to fill open roles with high-quality candidates within target timeframes.
5.  **Talent Growth:** Rate of promotions within the team and skill development of reports.

## Day-in-the-Life

**08:30 AM - Planning & Triage**
I review the team's Jira board and PagerDuty logs. I notice a flaky test caused a build failure overnight, so I ping the on-call engineer to look into it. I review the agenda for the upcoming sprint planning.

**09:30 AM - 1:1 with Senior Engineer**
I meet with Alex, a Senior Engineer. We skip the status update (that's for standup) and discuss her progress on leading the database migration. She's encountering resistance from another team. We role-play how she can approach the conversation to get buy-in. I promise to back her up if needed.

**10:30 AM - Sync with Product Manager**
I meet with the PM to review the roadmap for Q3. We debate the priority of a new feature vs. a necessary infrastructure upgrade. I use data on recent incidents to argue that the infra work is critical for stability. We agree on a compromise: we will do the infra work first, but reduce the scope of the feature to ship the MVP sooner.

**11:30 AM - Hiring Committee**
I sit on a hiring committee for a candidate interviewed by another team. We review the feedback packets. I challenge a "Soft No" that seems based on bias rather than evidence, asking the interviewer to clarify their concern. We agree to make an offer.

**01:00 PM - Focus Time / Strategic Work**
I spend an hour writing a promotion packet for one of my engineers. I gather evidence from code reviews, design docs, and peer feedback to build a strong case for their move to L4.

**02:00 PM - Team Design Review**
I sit in on a design review. The team is proposing a new microservice. I ask about the operational cost: "Who is going to patch this? Do we have the monitoring set up?" I ensure they aren't over-engineering the solution.

**03:00 PM - Recruiting Call**
I hop on a "sell call" with a top candidate who has an offer from a competitor. I talk about our engineering culture, the interesting challenges we're solving, and my philosophy on management. I try to understand what matters most to them (autonomy, mission, money) and tailor my pitch.

**04:00 PM - Crisis Management**
A critical bug is found in production. I jump into the incident slack channel. I don't debug the code myself, but I act as the Incident Commander. I ensure the right people are involved, manage communication to stakeholders, and keep the team focused on mitigation rather than root cause (for now).

**05:00 PM - Wrap Up**
I send a few "High Five" messages in our recognition tool to thank the team for handling the incident calmly. I clear my inbox and prep for tomorrow.

## Onboarding Plan (First 90 Days)

### Month 1: Listen and Learn
*   **Week 1:** Meet every team member (1:1s). Understand their history, goals, and pain points. Meet key partners (PM, Design).
*   **Week 2:** attend all team ceremonies (Standup, Retro, Planning) as an observer. Don't try to change anything yet.
*   **Week 3:** Understand the architecture and the product. Read design docs. Walk through the code (high level).
*   **Week 4:** Take over the facilitation of team meetings. Start handling administrative tasks (approving time off, expenses).

### Month 2: Build Trust & Small Wins
*   **Goal:** Establish yourself as a supportive leader.
*   **Actions:** Identify one "quick win" to improve a process frustration (e.g., shortening a meeting, fixing a broken tool). Conduct your first round of official 1:1s with career focus. Help close a hire.

### Month 3: Execute & Lead
*   **Goal:** Take full ownership of the team's delivery and health.
*   **Actions:** Lead the quarterly planning process. Handle a difficult conversation or performance issue. Propose a longer-term strategy for the team's technical roadmap.
