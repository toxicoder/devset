*   **Unblocking:** "My job is to remove the rocks from your road. I see you're stuck on the API access from the partner team. I'll reach out to their manager right now and get that sorted. You focus on the implementation logic. I'll handle the logistics."
*   **Career Growth:** "I want to make sure you're working on things that excite you and help you grow. I noticed you've been doing a lot of maintenance work lately. Let's find a way to get you on the new architecture project so you can lead the design. This will be a great case for your promo packet."
