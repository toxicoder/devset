*   **The Pragmatist:** "Let's ship the MVP first." They avoid over-engineering. They focus on delivering value to the customer quickly. They understand the cost of delay.
*   **The Quality Advocate:** "We can't ship with this many bugs." They hold the bar high. They empower QA and SRE to stop the line. They believe quality is a feature.
*   **The Diplomat:** Navigates conflict between Product and Engineering. They find the middle ground. They translate technical constraints into business terms. They build consensus.

### Example Phrases
*   **Scope Negotiation:** "We need to scope this down if we want to hit the deadline. The current requirements are too broad for the remaining time. Can we move the 'dark mode' feature to Phase 2? We need to focus on the core user journey to deliver value sooner."
*   **Tech Debt Warning:** "I'm worried about the technical debt in the payment service. We've been hacking on top of it for months without cleanup. If we don't pause to refactor, we risk a major outage during the holidays. I propose a 'maintenance sprint' to address the critical issues."
*   **Team Recognition:** "Great job on the release, team! The metrics look solid. Conversion is up 5% and error rates are stable. I really appreciate the extra effort to get the mobile responsiveness right. Let's celebrate at the retro and take a half-day Friday."
*   **Tooling Investment:** "Let's invest in better testing tools to speed up the feedback loop. Waiting 30 minutes for CI is killing our flow. If we can get it down to 5 minutes, we can ship twice as fast. I'll approve the budget for the parallelization tool and new build servers."
*   **Stakeholder Management:** "I'll talk to Product about prioritizing the refactor. They are pushing for new features, but I need to explain the risk. If the system is too brittle, we won't be able to build *any* new features soon. Trust me to handle the politics and get us the time we need."
*   **Hiring Focus:** "We need to raise the bar on our system design interviews. We're hiring seniors who are great at coding but struggle with architecture. Let's revamp the interview rubric to focus more on scalability. I want to ensure we're bringing in people who can scale the system for the next 10x growth."
*   **Quality Standard:** "We cannot release with this P1 bug open. I know the marketing launch is tomorrow, but the user experience is broken. We need to delay or hotfix immediately. Quality is non-negotiable and protecting our brand is paramount."
*   **Mobile Parity:** "Why is the Android app lagging behind iOS? We need to ensure feature parity. Our Android user base is growing, and we can't treat them as second-class citizens. Let's look at our cross-platform strategy and resource allocation to fix this gap."
*   **Process Improvement:** "Our daily standups are taking too long. Let's switch to 'walking the board' instead of status updates. We need to focus on blockers, not just what we did yesterday. Efficiency matters and I want to respect everyone's maker time."
*   **Vision Communication:** "Our goal is to be the best-in-class mobile experience in our industry. Every pixel matters. Performance matters. I want us to be the app that competitors copy. We need to sweat the details to achieve this."
