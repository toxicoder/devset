# Product Manager

**Role Code:** PROD2001

## Role Overview

The **Product Manager (PM)** acts as the "CEO of the Product," sitting at the intersection of Technology, Business, and User Experience. In this role, you are responsible for defining the **vision**, **strategy**, and **roadmap** for your product area. You do not just manage a backlog; you discover opportunities, validate hypotheses, and lead a cross-functional team to deliver value that solves real user problems.

A successful PM here is data-driven but customer-obsessed. You are comfortable diving into SQL to query usage data one minute and interviewing a user about their pain points the next. You must be a master storyteller, capable of rallying engineers, designers, and executives around a shared vision. You are accountable for the *outcome*, not just the *output*.

## Responsibilities

### Product Strategy & Vision
*   **Vision Setting:** Define a compelling long-term vision for your product that aligns with the company's broader mission. Articulate "where we are going" and "why it matters."
*   **Strategy Development:** Develop a strategic plan to achieve that vision. Identify the key bets, risks, and milestones. Use frameworks like "Where to Play / How to Win" to guide your thinking.
*   **Market Analysis:** Deeply understand the competitive landscape. Conduct SWOT analyses. Stay ahead of industry trends and emerging technologies that could disrupt or accelerate your product.
*   **Business Modeling:** Understand the business mechanics of your product. Define the business model (subscription, transaction, ad-based). Model pricing strategies and unit economics.

### Execution & Roadmap
*   **Roadmap Management:** Build and maintain a prioritized product roadmap. Balance new feature development with technical debt, bug fixes, and operational improvements. Use RICE or similar frameworks to prioritize ruthlessly.
*   **Discovery & Definition:** Translate high-level opportunities into clear, actionable requirements. Write detailed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and user stories. Ensure engineering has the "what" and "why" so they can determine the "how."
*   **Agile Leadership:** Act as the Product Owner in the agile process. maintain a healthy backlog. Participate in sprint planning, standups, and retrospectives. Accept user stories as "done."
*   **Launch Coordination:** Orchestrate the Go-To-Market (GTM) plan. Collaborate with Product Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support to ensure a successful launch. Define the "Whole Product" experience (docs, support, pricing).

### User Insights & Data
*   **User Research:** Be the voice of the customer. Conduct user interviews, surveys, and usability tests. Synthesize qualitative feedback into actionable insights. Build empathy for the user within the engineering team.
*   **Data Analytics:** Define success metrics (KPIs) for every feature. Instrument your product to track usage. Analyze funnels, retention cohorts, and engagement metrics to understand user behavior and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Experimentation:** Foster a culture of experimentation. Design A/B tests to validate hypotheses. meaningful interpretation of statistical results to make data-informed decisions.

### Stakeholder Management
*   **Alignment:** secure buy-in from key stakeholders (executives, other PMs, sales leaders). Manage expectations and communicate progress transparently.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Partner effectively with Engineering and Design. Respect their craft and empower them to make decisions. Work with Legal and Compliance to ensure regulatory adherence.

## PRD Standards (The "Big Tech" Way)

A great PRD is not a laundry list of requirements. It is a narrative document that convinces the team *why* we are building this.

1.  **Problem Statement:** What is the user pain point? Who is the user? (Use Personas)
2.  **Goals & Non-Goals:** What does success look like? What are we explicitly *not* doing?
3.  **Success Metrics:** How will we measure impact? (e.g., "Increase activation rate by 5%").
4.  **User Stories:** "As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]."
5.  **User Experience:** Link to Figma prototypes or include wireframes. Describe the "Happy Path" and "Edge Cases."
6.  **Technical Considerations:** (Filled in by Engineering) API changes, database impacts, security concerns.
7.  **Go-To-Market:** Release strategy (Beta, Phased Rollout, GA), marketing support.
8.  **FAQ:** Anticipate questions from the team and stakeholders.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1.  **North Star Metric:** The single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers to its customers (e.g., "Time Saved," "Daily Active Users").
2.  **Acquisition:** CAC, Traffic sources, Sign-up conversion rate.
3.  **Activation:** Time to first value, Onboarding completion rate.
4.  **Retention:** D30/D60/D90 retention, Churn rate.
5.  **Monetization:** ARPU, LTV, MRR (if applicable).
6.  **Satisfaction:** NPS, CSAT scores.

## Day-in-the-Life

**08:30 AM - Metric Check**
I open my dashboards (Mixpanel/Tableau). I check the results of the "New Onboarding Flow" A/B test launched yesterday. It looks like Variant B is showing a 10% lift in completion! I note this down to share with the team.

**09:00 AM - Daily Standup**
I join the engineering squad. I clarify a requirement about the "Export to PDF" feature. I accept a completed story from the previous day. I remind the team that the design review for the next sprint is this afternoon.

**10:00 AM - Customer Call**
I hop on a Zoom call with a key enterprise customer who gave us feedback about our reporting tool. I listen more than I talk. I dig deep into their workflow: "Walk me through exactly what you do with this report." I realize we are missing a critical filter they need.

**11:00 AM - PRD Writing**
I block out an hour to write the PRD for the new filter feature. I draft the user story, define the acceptance criteria, and ping the designer to start thinking about the UI.

**01:00 PM - Design Review**
I meet with the Product Designer and Tech Lead. We review the mocks for the upcoming "Mobile App" release. The engineer points out that one of the animations will be expensive to implement. We agree to a simpler version for V1 to ensure high performance.

**02:00 PM - Stakeholder Sync**
I meet with the VP of Sales. She is concerned that a competitor just launched a feature we don't have. I walk her through our roadmap and explain that while we don't have that exact feature, our upcoming release solves the same user problem in a better way. I equip her with talking points for her team.

**03:00 PM - Backlog Grooming**
I spend time cleaning up Jira. I prioritize the backlog for the next sprint, ensuring the highest value items are at the top. I add details to vague tickets.

**04:00 PM - Strategy Work**
I step back from the daily grind to think about Q4. I read a market research report on AI trends in our industry. I start drafting a "One-Pager" for a potential new product line involving generative AI.

**05:00 PM - Wrap Up**
I send a weekly update email to the company summarizing our team's progress, highlighting the A/B test win, and linking to the latest PRD.

## Onboarding Plan (First 90 Days)

### Month 1: Sponge Mode
*   **Goal:** Understand the product, the user, and the market.
*   **Actions:** Use the product every day. Read all existing PRDs and strategy docs. Listen to 10 recorded sales calls. Interview 5 customers. Meet 1:1 with every engineer and designer on your squad.

### Month 2: Contribution
*   **Goal:** Ship something and build trust.
*   **Actions:** Take ownership of a small feature or improvement. Write your first PRD. Lead a backlog grooming session. Analyze data to find one low-hanging fruit optimization.

### Month 3: Leadership
*   **Goal:** Own the roadmap and strategy.
*   **Actions:** define the roadmap for the next quarter. Present a strategy update to leadership. Propose a new experiment based on your data analysis.

## Interview Process Guide

1.  **Recruiter Screen:** Experience fit, communication style.
2.  **Product Sense (Case Study):** "Design a feature for [App X] to improve [Metric Y]." Focus on user empathy and creativity.
3.  **Product Execution (Metrics):** "You launched a feature and metrics dropped by 10%. How do you investigate?" Focus on analytical rigor.
4.  **Leadership & Behavioral:** "Tell me about a time you said 'no' to a stakeholder."
