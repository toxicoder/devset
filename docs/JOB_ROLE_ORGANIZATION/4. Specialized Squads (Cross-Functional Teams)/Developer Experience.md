# Developer Experience

## Purpose
Building internal tools and CI/CD pipelines to make other engineers faster.

## Responsibilities

### Tooling & Automation
*   Design, build, and maintain internal CLI tools and dashboards to streamline common development tasks.
*   Automate environment provisioning and configuration management to reduce setup time for new engineers.
*   Integrate third-party developer tools (e.g., GitHub, Jira, Slack) to create a cohesive workflow.
*   Develop self-service portals for infrastructure requests, reducing dependency on operations teams.

### CI/CD Pipeline Management
*   Architect and optimize Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for speed and reliability.
*   Implement automated testing gates (unit, integration, e2e) to ensure code quality before deployment.
*   Manage artifact repositories and ensure secure supply chain practices.
*   Monitor pipeline performance and troubleshoot build failures to minimize developer downtime.

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
*   Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date technical documentation for internal platforms and tools.
*   Create tutorials, codelabs, and onboarding guides to help engineers adopt new tools and best practices.
*   Facilitate knowledge sharing sessions and internal tech talks to foster a culture of learning.
*   Gather feedback from the engineering team to identify pain points and prioritize tooling improvements.
