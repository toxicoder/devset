# Security Red Team

## Purpose
Ethical hacking squad finding vulnerabilities in our own products.

## Responsibilities

### Penetration Testing
*   Conduct regular black-box, gray-box, and white-box penetration tests on web applications, mobile apps, and APIs.
*   Simulate real-world attack scenarios to identify exploitable vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.
*   Test network infrastructure, wireless systems, and physical security controls for weaknesses.
*   Document findings with detailed reproduction steps and risk assessments (CVSS scoring).

### Social Engineering & Simulation
*   Design and execute phishing campaigns to test employee awareness and response to social engineering attacks.
*   Perform physical security assessments to test access controls and badge entry systems.
*   Simulate advanced persistent threats (APT) to test the Blue Team's detection and response capabilities.
*   Provide training and feedback to employees based on the results of social engineering exercises.

### Vulnerability Research & Tool Development
*   Research new attack vectors and zero-day vulnerabilities relevant to the organization's technology stack.
*   Develop custom exploit scripts and security testing tools to automate vulnerability discovery.
*   Analyze third-party libraries and dependencies for known security flaws.
*   Collaborate with engineering teams to provide remediation guidance and verify fixes.

## Composition
*   SEC1001 (3)
