# Mobile Platform

## Purpose
Maintains core mobile architecture used by feature squads.

## Responsibilities

### Core Architecture & Frameworks
*   Design and maintain the foundational architecture for iOS and Android applications (e.g., modularization, navigation).
*   Develop shared libraries and UI components to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication across feature squads.
*   Evaluate and integrate new mobile technologies, languages (Swift, Kotlin), and frameworks.
*   Enforce coding standards and architectural patterns through code reviews and linting rules.

### Release Management & DevOps
*   Manage the mobile release lifecycle, including beta testing (TestFlight, Play Console) and App Store submissions.
*   Automate build, test, and release processes using tools like Fastlane and CI/CD platforms.
*   Monitor crash rates and application performance (ANRs, launch time) using observability tools.
*   Handle signing certificates, provisioning profiles, and API keys securely.

### Performance & Quality
*   Optimize application performance, focusing on battery usage, memory management, and network efficiency.
*   Implement and maintain automated testing frameworks for unit, UI, and integration tests.
*   Conduct regular performance audits and profiling to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
*   Ensure the application is accessible and responsive across a wide range of devices and OS versions.
