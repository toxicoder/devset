# AI Ethics & Safety

## Purpose
Reviews ML models for bias and toxicity.

## Responsibilities

### Bias Detection & Mitigation
*   Evaluate machine learning models for demographic bias and fairness across different user groups.
*   Develop and apply metrics to quantify fairness and discrimination in algorithmic decision-making.
*   Curate and balance training datasets to reduce underrepresentation.
*   Implement post-processing techniques to mitigate bias in model outputs.

### Model Governance & Accountability
*   Establish frameworks for model documentation (Model Cards) and versioning.
*   Define acceptable use policies and safety guidelines for AI deployment.
*   Conduct "red teaming" exercises to identify potential misuse or harmful outputs.
*   Ensure explainability and interpretability of high-stakes AI models.

### Safety Research & Policy
*   Research emerging risks in AI safety, such as hallucination, toxicity, and alignment.
*   Collaborate with policymakers and external organizations to shape AI regulations.
*   Develop monitoring systems to detect model drift or unsafe behavior in production.
*   Advocate for ethical AI practices within the broader engineering culture.
