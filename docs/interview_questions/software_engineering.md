## Part 1: Algorithms & Data Structures (1-20)

### 1. Explain Big O Notation.

Big O notation describes the **worst-case** performance or complexity of an algorithm. It characterizes the execution time or space used as the input size ($n$) grows.

| Notation | Name | Example Algorithm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $O(1)$ | Constant | Accessing array index |
| $O(\log n)$ | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| $O(n)$ | Linear | Linear Search |
| $O(n \log n)$ | Linearithmic | Merge Sort |
| $O(n^2)$ | Quadratic | Bubble Sort |

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Candidate mentions Space Complexity.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What is the space complexity of a recursive Fibonacci function without memoization?"
    *   *Answer:* $O(n)$ (stack depth).

### 2. Array vs. Linked List?

*   **Array:** Contiguous memory. $O(1)$ access. $O(n)$ insertion/deletion (shifting). Fixed size (usually).
*   **Linked List:** Non-contiguous. $O(n)$ access. $O(1)$ insertion/deletion (if pointer known). Dynamic size.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Cache Locality.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "Why are Arrays generally faster for iteration than Linked Lists?"
    *   *Answer:* Spatial locality / CPU caching. Arrays are contiguous blocks.

### 3. What is a Hash Table?

A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Key --> HashFunction
    HashFunction --> Index
    Index --> Bucket[Bucket / Storage]
```

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Collisions.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "How do you handle collisions?"
    *   *Answer:* Chaining (Linked Lists in buckets) or Open Addressing (Probing).

### 4. Stack vs. Queue?

*   **Stack:** LIFO (Last In, First Out). Operations: `push`, `pop`. Used in recursion, undo mechanisms.
*   **Queue:** FIFO (First In, First Out). Operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`. Used in job scheduling, BFS.

### 5. Explain Binary Search.

An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a **sorted** list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item.

**Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Pre-requisites.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What happens if the array is not sorted?"
    *   *Answer:* Binary search fails. You must sort first ($O(n \log n)$) or use Linear Search ($O(n)$).

### 6. What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?

A node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Balancing.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "What is the worst-case search time in a BST?"
    *   *Answer:* $O(n)$ if the tree becomes a skewed line. Balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black) guarantee $O(\log n)$.

### 7. BFS vs. DFS?

*   **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Explores neighbor nodes first. Uses a **Queue**. Good for finding shortest path in unweighted graphs.
*   **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses a **Stack** (recursion). Good for puzzles, topological sort.

### 8. Explain QuickSort.

A divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a **pivot** and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

**Candidate Response Paths:**

*   **Path A: Pivot Selection.**
    *   *Follow-up:* "How can you avoid the worst-case scenario?"
    *   *Answer:* Pick a random pivot or median-of-three.

### 9. Explain Merge Sort.

A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

*   **Complexity:** Always $O(n \log n)$.
*   **Stability:** Stable sort (maintains relative order of equal elements).

### 10. What is Dynamic Programming?

    return root
```

*Example:* Dijkstra's Algorithm, Huffman Coding.

### 18. How to find duplicates in an array in $O(n)$ time?

Use a **HashSet** or a **Frequency Map**. Iterate through the array; if the element is already in the set, it's a duplicate.

### 19. What is a Trie (Prefix Tree)?

A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings.
**Use Case:** Autocomplete systems.

### 20. String Immutability.
