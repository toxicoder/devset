# User Management Group Hierarchy

## 1. Overview
This document defines the complete group hierarchy used for **User Management** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
Access permissions in our system are assigned to **Groups**. Users are members of one or more groups based on their **Department**, **Squad**, and **Job Role**.

The group structure mirrors the [Organizational Architecture](/devset/job_roles/job_role_organization/), ensuring that access rights automatically align with an employee's function and responsibilities.

### Group Naming Convention
Groups are identified by a unique slug following this convention:
`group:<type>:<name>`

*   **Type**:
    *   `org`: Top-level organizational units (Departments).
    *   `team`: Sub-departments or functional teams.
    *   `squad`: Cross-functional execution squads.
    *   `role`: Specific job roles (e.g., for role-specific tool access).
    *   `global`: Company-wide groups.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy Graph

The following graph illustrates the inheritance structure. Child groups inherit permissions from parent groups.
