# Code Quality

## Course Overview
**Course Title:** Code Quality
**Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
**Format:** Self-paced Reading & Hands-on Labs

## Learning Objectives
*   Articulate the core principles of Code Quality.
*   Apply best practices to real-world engineering scenarios.
*   Troubleshoot common issues and optimize performance.

## Core Curriculum
## The "Boy Scout Rule"
Always leave the code better than you found it.

## Clean Code Principles
* **Meaningful Names**: Use intention-revealing names.
* **Functions**: Should do one thing, do it well, and do it only.
* **Comments**: Do not comment bad code—rewrite it. Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.

## Refactoring
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.

### When to Refactor
* **Rule of Three**: Three strikes and you refactor.
* **When you add a feature**: Refactor to make the feature easier to add.
* **When you fix a bug**: Refactor to make the bug obvious.
* **During Code Review**: Refactor based on feedback.

## Technical Debt
Technical debt is a metaphor for the accumulation of sub-optimal technical decisions. Like financial debt, it incurs interest (maintenance cost) and must be paid down (refactoring).

## Hands-on Exercises
1.  **Review:** Read the core curriculum carefully.
2.  **Apply:** Identify one area in your current project where this applies.
3.  **Prototype:** Create a small proof-of-concept in your sandbox environment.

## Assessment
*   Complete the knowledge check in the Learning Management System (LMS).

## Resources
*   Internal Wiki
*   Official Documentation
