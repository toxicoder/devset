# Giving Feedback

## Principles
We strive for a culture of open, honest, and constructive feedback.

## The SBI Model
When giving feedback, structure it using **Situation, Behavior, Impact**:
1.  **Situation**: Describe the specific situation.
2.  **Behavior**: Describe the observed behavior (facts, not assumptions).
3.  **Impact**: Explain the impact that behavior had on you or the team.

*Example*: "In yesterday's planning meeting (Situation), you interrupted Jane three times while she was presenting (Behavior). This caused her to shut down and we missed her valuable input (Impact)."

## Radical Candor
Care Personally + Challenge Directly.
* **Obnoxious Aggression**: Challenge without Care (brutal honesty).
* **Ruinous Empathy**: Care without Challenge (avoiding conflict to be "nice").
* **Manipulative Insincerity**: Neither Care nor Challenge (passive-aggressive).
* **Radical Candor**: High Care + High Challenge.
