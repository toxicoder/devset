# Effective Communication

## Asynchronous vs. Synchronous

### When to use Async (Docs, Email, Chat)
* Status updates.
* Non-urgent questions.
* Documentation of decisions.
* Deep work protection.

### When to use Sync (Meetings, Calls)
* Urgent incidents.
* Complex brainstorming.
* Emotional or sensitive discussions.
* Team bonding.

## Writing Effective Documentation
* **Know Your Audience**: Are you writing for execs, engineers, or users?
* **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: Put the most important information first.
* **Keep it Concise**: Use bullet points and headers.
* **Maintain it**: Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.
