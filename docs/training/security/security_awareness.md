# Security Awareness

## Phishing
Phishing is the most common attack vector.
* **Verify the Sender**: Check the email address carefully.
* **Don't Click Links**: Hover over links to see the actual URL.
* **Report Suspicious Emails**: Use the "Report Phishing" button in your email client.

## Password Hygiene
* **Use a Password Manager**: 1Password or LastPass.
* **Enable MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication is mandatory for all internal systems.
* **Unique Passwords**: Never reuse passwords across sites.

## Physical Security
* **Badge Access**: Never let anyone tailgating into the building.
* **Lock Your Screen**: Win+L (Windows) or Ctrl+Cmd+Q (Mac) when stepping away.
* **Clean Desk Policy**: Do not leave sensitive documents on your desk.
