# Product Thinking

## User Empathy
* **Walk in their shoes**: Use the product daily ("Dogfooding").
* **Listen to users**: Participate in user research or support calls.

## Problem vs. Solution
* Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
* Ask "Why?" five times to get to the root cause.

## Metrics that Matter
* **North Star Metric**: The single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers.
* **Vanity Metrics**: Numbers that look good but don't correlate to success (e.g., total downloads vs. active users).

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
* Build the smallest thing that delivers value and allows us to learn.
* It's not "half-baked"—it's a slice of the cake.
