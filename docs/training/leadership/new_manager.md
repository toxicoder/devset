# New Manager Guide

## Transitioning from Maker to Manager
* **Shift your mindset**: Your output is now the output of your team.
* **Let go of the code**: You cannot be the primary coder and an effective manager.

## The 1:1 Meeting
* **Frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly.
* **Agenda**: Driven by the direct report.
* **Focus**: Career growth, blockers, feedback (not just status updates).

## Performance Management
* **Set Clear Expectations**: Use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).
* **Continuous Feedback**: Don't wait for the annual review.
* **Documentation**: Keep a record of wins and areas for improvement.

## Hiring
* **The Bar**: Hire people better than you.
* **Culture Add**: Look for diverse perspectives that add to our culture, not just fit in.
