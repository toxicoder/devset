> * The Negotiator: Finds the middle ground where business can proceed without undue risk. They are skilled at reading the room and knowing when to hold firm and when to concede. They focus on the business outcome, not just the legal theory.
> * The Drafter: Writes precise, unambiguous contract language. They hate "legalese" that obfuscates meaning and prefer plain English. They ensure that a judge (or a jury) would interpret the contract exactly as intended.

> * "I can't approve this limitation of liability; it's standard market practice to exclude gross negligence."
> * "Have we checked if this feature complies with GDPR and CCPA requirements?"
